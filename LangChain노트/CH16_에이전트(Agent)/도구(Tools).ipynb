LangChain aims to develop data-aware and agentic applications that enable language models to communicate with their surroundings and establish connections with other data sources, rather than only calling out to a language model via an API.\\nAt the heart of LangChain are two key components. The first one is the modular abstractions provided by LangChain, which are essential for working with language models. These components are designed to be easy to use, whether you use the rest of the LangChain framework or not.\\nThe Use-Case Specific Chains make up the second part. These might be conceptualized as putting together the required parts in a certain order to complete a certain use case. These chains are intended to serve as a more advanced interface that makes it simple for users to begin a particular use case. Additionally, they are adaptable, giving you flexibility according to the requirements of the application.\\nMoreover, LangChain is context-aware, allowing applications to make decisions depending on the context that is supplied by linking a language model to context-giving sources. Because of this, LangChain is a crucial tool for creating apps that can communicate with language models and make deft choices depending on the environment.\\nFrom the high level of LangChain framework, the main components include:\\n\\nArchitecture and Workflow\\nModules and Models\\nEmbeddings and VectorStor\\nChains and Retrievers\\n\\nTechnical Requirements\\nTo grasp “LangChain Fundamentals”, you’ll need proficiency in Python, including its data science libraries, and a kind of understanding of large language models like LLaMA, Mistral and Gemma. Knowledge of data structures is essential for efficient data processing. Familiarity with machine learning and natural language processing concepts will be beneficial, given LangChain’s focus on language models. Basic understanding of APIs is required for data interactions.\\nIn practical projects, deploying a large language model (LLM) as a service typically involves launching it in a Docker container, or Kubernetes. Hence, having familiarity with containers would also be advantageous.\\nLangChain is an open-source tool with a Python and JavaScript codebase. However, the examples provided in this guide exclusively focus on Python.\\nWhat is LangChain?\\nImagine a scenario where you have many business reports and you’re scheduled to have a business meeting with your higher management next Monday. However, you have yet to create a summary of these reports. Wouldn’t it be convenient if you could simply ask your text reports to highlight the key points you need to discuss? LangChain is designed to make this task a reality.\\nLangChain is an open-source framework designed to help build applications powered by LLMs, like ChatGPT, and create more advanced use cases around LLMs by chaining together different components from several modules.\\nLet’s look at some of the features of LangChain:\\n\\nIt is an innovative technology that aims to bridge the gap between languages and facilitate communication on a global scale.\\nIt leverages artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and natural language processing (NLP) to enable real-time translation and interpretation services, not only human languages, but also programming languages.\\nIt can be used to develop intelligent applications, such as chatbots, semantic optimization, text generation and summarization, and programming language translation.\\nIt offers endless possibilities for creating powerful applications that harness the capabilities of LLMs.\\nIt is an open-source framework that streamlines the development of applications utilizing large language models like OpenAI or Hugging Face.\\nIt offers end-to-end chains integration to facilitate working with various programming languages, platforms, and data sources.\\n\\nBy leveraging these features, developers can create powerful and innovative applications that leverage the power of language models.\\nLangChain is not without its challenges, and there are concerns regarding privacy, accuracy, and potential biases in LangChain. We’ll discuss this later in the book.\\nWhat Problem does LangChain Resolve?\\nThe goal of LangChain is to address the different issues that arise while developing applications with LLMs. Important problems that LangChain aims to solve include:\\n\\nStandardizing prompt structures: By making the prompt structure simpler, LangChain helps developers who collaborate with LLMs to work more efficiently. Innovative open-source projects like Lepton and AutoPrompt, accessible on GitHub, focus to standardize prompt structure metadata to address the issue of Language Models struggling to comprehend prompts.\\nStrengthening integration capabilities: LangChain guarantees the smooth application of LLM outputs among various modules and libraries.\\nSimplifying model switching: With LangChain, developers may quickly move between different LLM models, as well as embedding models for VectorStore, in their applications. I am particularly fond of Quivr, a concept known as the “second brain”, which streamlines prompt editing, facilitates model transitions, connects the front-end with the back-end, and supports ongoing conversations while ensuring user access authentication. Similar services can be discovered on platforms such as Phind.com, Perplexity.ai, and Poe.com, among others.\\nEffective memory management: LangChain helps maintain memory records, e.g. follow-up conversation, as needed while developing applications.\\nOptimizing data handling: LangChain improves overall efficiency by streamlining data management in LLM-driven systems.\\n\\nWith its framework, LangChain improves the development process with LLMs by providing tools and features that are tailored to address the typical obstacles that developers face while working with AI and data engineering.\\nLangChain AI\\nSearch \\n\\nHome\\n\\n\\n\\nPreface\\nLangChain Fundamentals\\nLangChain Architecture\\nSelect a Right Language Model\\nLLM Settings and Limits\\nThoughts on Prompt Engineering\\nEmbeddings and VectorStore\\nChains and Retriever\\nDocument and Debugging\\nSummary\\n\\n\\n\\nTools and Libraries\\n\\n\\nDocument Summarization\\n\\n\\nTicketing System\\n\\n\\nKnowledgeBase Semantic Analysis\\n\\n\\nTalk to Your GraphDB\\n\\n\\nFuture of LangChain and AI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLanguage\\n\\n\\nTheme \\n\\n\\nClear History\\n\\n\\nBuilt with by Hugo'},\n",

While both have unique strengths, their differences cater to specific use cases. Let’s dive into what sets them apart and when to use each.\\n\\nWhat is LangChain?\\nLangChain is a framework for building LLM-powered applications by chaining a sequence of functions together.\\nKey Features\\n\\nCore Functionality: Executes a sequence of tasks such as retrieving data, summarizing it, and answering user questions.\\nModular Components:\\nDocument Loaders: Fetch and load content from various sources.\\nText Splitters: Break large documents into smaller, meaningful chunks.\\nPrompt Components: Create instructions for LLMs.\\nMemory Components: Store conversational history and context.\\n\\n\\n\\nExample Workflow\\n\\nRetrieve: Use a document loader and text splitter to gather data.\\nSummarize: Leverage a chain with a prompt component and an LLM to summarize.\\nAnswer: Create a chain to answer user questions, incorporating memory and prompts.\\n\\nLangChain’s modular architecture enables the creation of complex workflows by combining these components.\\n\\nWhat is LangGraph?\\nLangGraph is a specialized library within the LangChain ecosystem, designed for stateful, multi-agent systems handling nonlinear workflows.\\nKey Features\\n\\nGraph Structure: Represents tasks as nodes and their transitions as edges, allowing dynamic interactions.\\nState Management: A central state component ensures contextual information is accessible and modifiable by all nodes.\\nFlexibility: Handles tasks in any order, always returning to a central “process input” node.\\n\\nExample Use Case\\nA task management assistant:\\n\\nProcess Input: Identify user intent using an LLM.\\nAdd Tasks: Update the task list.\\nComplete Tasks: Mark tasks as finished.\\nSummarize: Generate an overview of current tasks using an LLM.\\n\\nThe graph-based structure supports dynamic workflows, making it ideal for interactive systems.\\n\\nDirect Comparison: LangChain vs LangGraph\\n| Dimension | LangChain | LangGraph |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| Primary Focus | Sequential chaining of LLM operations. | Stateful multi-agent systems and nonlinear workflows. |\\n| Structure | Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for step-by-step tasks. | Graph structure with loops and dynamic transitions. |\\n| State Management | Limited, with memory components for basic persistence. | Robust, with state as a core, accessible component. |\\n| Components | Document loaders, memory, prompts, LLMs, agents. | Nodes, edges, states, transitions. |\\n| Use Cases | Sequential tasks like data retrieval and summarization. | Complex, adaptive systems like virtual assistants. |\\n\\nWhen to Use Each Framework\\nChoose LangChain If:\\n\\nYou need a straightforward sequence of tasks (e.g., retrieve → process → output).\\nYour workflow doesn’t require persistent, complex state management.\\nModularity and component abstraction are your priorities.\\n\\nChoose LangGraph If:\\n\\nYour application involves dynamic interactions or tasks with evolving conditions.\\nYou need robust state management for maintaining context across extended interactions.\\nUse cases involve multi-agent systems or complex workflows (e.g., virtual assistants).\\n\\n\\nFinal Thoughts\\nLangChain and LangGraph are powerful frameworks for leveraging large language models, each tailored to specific needs. While LangChain excels at structured, sequential workflows, LangGraph shines in dynamic, stateful systems. The choice depends on the complexity of your application and its requirements.\\nTags: AI Frameworks, LangChain, LangGraph, LLM Applications, Stateful Agents\\nShare on\\nTwitter Facebook LinkedIn\\nPrevious Next\\nYou May Also Enjoy\\nQuantum Computing Explained: The Future of Supercomputing\\n5 minute read\\nPublished: February 27, 2025\\n🧑\\u200d💻 What is Quantum Computing?\\nGraphRAG: Enhancing Accuracy and Insights in Retrieval-Augmented Generation\\n3 minute read\\nPublished: February 19, 2025\\n🔎 Imagine you’re running a healthcare support line.\\nPatients and providers call in with complex multi-step questions that require precise, personalized responses—where both accuracy and speed matter.\\nGrok 3: The World’s Smartest AI?

Output Parsers\\nUsage: Parses the output of LLM, able to parse into different formats.\\n# 3.2. Chains\\nUsage: Combines multiple components to create a single cohesive task. Multiple Chains can be nested or combined with other components to build more complex Chains.\\n# 3.3. Agents\\nUsage: Based on user input, plans and makes decisions using LLM. It can divide tasks into smaller parts or decide the behavior of each step, integrating various tools and dynamically choosing whether to use a tool and which tool to use.\\nKey Concepts:\\n\\nAgent: An Agent makes a decision based on the current situation. It dynamically decides whether to respond directly or use a tool, and if using a tool, which one to choose.\\nAgentExecutor: Essentially a Chain, AgentExecutor is an iterator for the Agent. It repeatedly calls the Agent to make decisions until a satisfactory result is achieved or a predefined limit is reached.\\n\\nAgentExecutor can be seen as an intelligent entity, and Agent is like the brain of this entity. When a user asks a question, AgentExecutor thinks once or multiple times, i.e., it calls the Agent to make decisions until it reaches a satisfactory result or the predefined limit.\\n# 3.4. Retrieval\\nUsage: An abstraction of integrated data sources, including data loading, processing, vectorization, storage, and retrieval, allowing users to have their knowledge base.\\n# 3.5. Callbacks\\nUsage: Records relevant information during the execution of a Chain, typically used for logging, recording intermediate steps, recording token usage for billing, and controlling flow rate.\\n# 3.6. Memory\\nUsage: Records historical conversations to supplement historical context in subsequent dialogues, enabling the model to have continuous conversations.\\n# 4.

The library includes output parsers to get content extracted from the keyword defined in the prompt. Example is the chain of thought keywords of Thought, Action, Observation.\\nGetting started¶\\nThe LangChain documentation is excellent so no need to write more. All my study codes with LangChain and LLM are in different folders of this repo:\\n| Backend | Type of chains |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| openAI | The implementation of the quickstart examples, RAG, chatbot, agent |\\n| Ollama | run a simple query to Ollama (running Llama 3.2) locally |\\n| Anthropic Claude |  |\\n| Mistral LLM |  |\\n| IBM WatsonX |  |\\n| AWS Bedrock | zero_shot generation |\\nEach code needs to define only the needed LangChain modules to keep the executable size low.\\nMain Concepts¶\\nModel I/O¶\\nModel I/O are building blocks to interface with any language model. It facilitates the interface of model input (prompts) with the LLM model to produce the model output.\\n\\nLangChain supports two types of language: LLM (for pure text completion models) or ChatModel (conversation on top of LLM using constructs of AIMessage, HumanMessage)\\n\\nLangChain uses Prompt templates to control LLM behavior.\\n\\nTwo common prompt templates: string prompt templates and chat prompt templates.\\n\\nfromlangchain_core.promptsimport ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder\\nprompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([\\n    (\"system\", \"Answer the user\\'s questions based on the below context:\\\\n\\\\n{context}\"),\\n    MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=\"chat_history\"),\\n    (\"user\", \"{input}\"),\\n])\\n* We can build custom prompt by extending existing default templates. An example is a \\'few-shot-examples\\' in a chat prompt using FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate. * LangChain offers a prompt hub to get predefined prompts easily loadable:\\nfromlangchainimport hub\\nprompt = hub.pull(\"hwchase17/openai-functions-agent\")\\n\\n\\nChains allow developers to combine multiple components together (or to combine other chains) to create a single, coherent application.\\n\\n\\nOutputParsers convert the raw output of a language model into a format that can be used downstream\\n\\n\\nFeature stores, like Feast, can be a great way to keep information about the user conversation or query, and LangChain provides an easy way to combine data from Feast with LLMs.\\nChain¶\\nChains are runnable, observable and composable. The LangChain framework uses the Runnable class to encapsulate operations that can be run synchronously or asynchronously.\\n\\n\\nLLMChain class is the basic chain to integrate with any LLM.\\n```\\nBasic chain\\nchain = LLMChain(llm=model, prompt = prompt)\\nchain.invoke(\"a query\")\\n```\\n\\n\\nSequential chain combines chains in sequence with single input and output (SimpleSequentialChain)\\noverall_simple_chain = SimpleSequentialChain(chains=[chain_one, chain_two],\\n                                            verbose=True\\n                                            )\\nor multiple inputs and outputs with prompt using the different environment variables (see this code).\\n\\n\\nLLMRouterChain is a chain that outputs the name of a destination chain and the inputs to it.\\n\\n\\nLangChain Expression Language is a declarative way to define chains. It looks similar to Unix shell pipe: input for one runnable comes from the output of predecessor (This is why prompt below is a runnable).\\n```\\na chain definition using Langchain expression language\\nchain = prompt | model | output_parser\\n```\\n\\n\\nChain can be executed asynchronously in its own Thread using the ainvoke method.\\n\\n\\nRunnable¶\\nRunnable interface is a protocol to define custom chains and invoke them. Each Runnable exposes methods to get input, output and config schemas. Each implements synchronous and async invoke methods and batch. Runnable can run in parallel or in sequence.\\nTo pass data to a Runnable there is the RunnablePassthrough class. This is used in conjunction with RunnableParallel to assign data to key in a map.\\n```\\nfromlangchain.schema.runnableimport RunnableParallel, RunnablePassthrough\\nrunnable = RunnableParallel(\\n   passed = RunnablePassthrough(),\\n   extra= RunnablePassthrough.assign(mult= lambda x:x[\"num\"] * 3),\\n   modified=lambda x:x[\"num\"] +1 \\n)\\nprint(runnable.invoke({\"num\": 6}))\\n{\\'passed\\': {\\'num\\': 6}, \\'extra\\': {\\'num\\': 6, \\'mult\\': 18}, \\'modified\\': 7}\\n```\\n\\nRunnableLambda is a type of Runnable that wraps a callable function.\\n\\nsequence = RunnableLambda(lambda x: x + 1) | {\\n    \\'mul_2\\': RunnableLambda(lambda x: x * 2),\\n    \\'mul_5\\': RunnableLambda(lambda x: x * 5)\\n}\\nsequence.invoke(1)\\nThe RunnablePassthrough.assign method is used to create a Runnable that passes the input through while adding some keys to the output.\\nWe can use Runnable.bind() to pass arguments as constants accessible within a runnable sequence (a chain) where argument is not part of the output of preceding runnables in the sequence.\\nSee some code RunnableExamples\\nMemory¶\\nLarge Language Models are stateless and do not remember anything. Chatbot seems to have memory, because conversation is kept in the context.\\nWith a simple conversation like the following code, the conversation is added as string into the context:\\nllm = ChatOpenAI(temperature = 0)\\nmemory = ConversationBufferMemory()\\nconversation = ConversationChain(\\n    llm= llm,\\n    memory=memory,\\n    verbose=True   # trace the chain\\n)\\nThe memory is just a container in which we can save {\"input:\"\"} and {\"output\": \"\"} content.\\nBut as the conversation goes, the size of the context grows, and so the cost of operating this chatbot, as API are charged by the size of the token. Using ConversationBufferWindowMemory(k=1) with a k necessary to keep enough context, we can limit cost. Same with ConversationTokenBufferMemory to limit the token in memory.\\nConversationChain is a predefined chain to have a conversation and load context from memory.\\nAs part of memory component there is the ConversationSummaryMemory to get the conversation summary so far.\\nThe other important memory is Vector Data memory and entity memory or knowledgeGraph\\nSee related code conversation_with_memory.py\\nRetrieval Augmented Generation¶\\nThe goal for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is to add custom dataset not already part of a trained model and use the dataset as input sent to the LLM. RAG is illustrated in figure below:\\n\\nEmbed is the vector representation of a chunk of text. Different embedding can be used.\\nEmbeddingsThe classical Embedding is the OpenAIEmbeddings but Hugging Face offers an open source version: the SentenceTransformershttps://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers which is a Python framework for state-of-the-art sentence, text and image embeddings.\\n```\\nfromlangchain_openaiimport OpenAIEmbeddings\\nvectorstore =  Chroma.from_documents(documents=splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings(),\\n                                     persist_directory=DOMAIN_VS_PATH)\\nWith HuggingFace\\nfromsentence_transformersimport SentenceTransformer\\ndefbuild_embedding(docs):\\n    model = SentenceTransformer(\"all-MiniLM-L6-v2\")\\n    return model.encode(docs)\\nWith AWS embedding\\nfromlangchain.embeddingsimport BedrockEmbeddings\\n```\\nDifferent code that implement RAG\\n| Code | Notes |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| build_agent_domain_rag.py | Read Lilian Weng blog and create a ChromeDB vector store with OpenAIEmbeddings |\\n| query_agent_domain_store.py | Query the persisted vector store for similarity search |\\n| prepareVectorStore.py | Use AWS Bedrock Embeddings |\\n| embeddings_hf.py | Use Hunggingface embeddings with splitting a markdown file and use FAISS vector store |\\n| rag_HyDE.py | Hypothetical Document Embedding (HyDE) the first prompt create an hypothetical document |\\nCreating chunks is necessary because language models generally have a limit to the amount of token they can deal with. It also improve the similarity search based on vector.\\nSplit docs and save in vector storeRecursiveCharacterTextSplitter splits text by recursively look at characters. text_splitter.split_documents(documents) return a list of Document which is a wrapper to page content and some metadata for the indexes from the source document.\\n```\\n...\\nfromlangchain.text_splitterimport RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter\\nfromlangchain.vectorstoresimport FAISS\\nfromlangchain.indexes.vectorstoreimport VectorStoreIndexWrapper\\nloader = PyPDFDirectoryLoader(\"./data/\")\\ndocuments = loader.load()\\ntext_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(\\n    chunk_size = 1000,\\n    chunk_overlap  = 100,\\n)\\ndocs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)\\nvectorstore_faiss = FAISS.from_documents(\\n    docs,\\n    embeddings,\\n)\\nvectorstore_faiss.save_local(\"faiss_index\")\\n```\\nSearch similarity in vector DBOpenAIEmbeddings\\nembeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(model=\"text-embedding-3-large\", dimensions=1024)\\nquery = \"\"\"Is it possible that ...?\"\"\"\\nquery_embedding = embeddings.embed_query(query)\\nrelevant_documents = vectorstore_faiss.similarity_search_by_vector(query_embedding)\\nDuring the interaction with the end-user, the system (a chain in LangChain) retrieves the most relevant data to the question asked, and passes it to LLM in the generation step.\\n\\nEmbeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text to help do similarity search\\nPersist the embeddings into a Vector store. Faiss and ChromaDB are common vector stores to use, but OpenSearch, Postgresql can also being used.\\nRetriever includes semantic search and efficient algorithm to prepare the prompt.

PromptTemplates allow us to create generic shells which can be populated with information and get model outputs based on different scenarios. See the text_generation/ResponseToUnhappyCustomer.py code.\\n\\nSummarization chain¶\\nAlways assess the size of the content to send, as the approach can be different: for big document, we need to split the doc in chunks.\\n\\nSmall text summary with OpenAI.\\nSmall text to summarize, with bedrock client and the invoke_model on the client see the code in llm-langchain/summarization/SmallTextSummarization.py\\nFor big document, langchain provides the load_summarize_chain to summarize by chunks and get the summary of the summaries. See code with \\'manual\\' extraction of the summaries as insights and then creating a summary of insights in summarization/long-text-summarization.py or using a LangChain summarization with map-reduce in summarization/long-text-summarization-mr.py.\\n\\nUsing langchain summarize chain\\n```\\nfromlangchain.text_splitterimport RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter\\nfromlangchain.llms.bedrockimport Bedrock\\nfromlangchain.chains.summarizeimport load_summarize_chain\\nllm = Bedrock(\\n    model_id=modelId,\\n    model_kwargs={\\n        \"max_tokens_to_sample\": 1000,\\n    },\\n    client=boto3_bedrock,\\n) \\ntext_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(\\n    separators=[\"\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\"], chunk_size=4000, chunk_overlap=100\\n)\\ndocs = text_splitter.create_documents([letter])\\nsummary_chain = load_summarize_chain(llm=llm, chain_type=\"map_reduce\", verbose=True)\\noutput = summary_chain.run(docs)\\n```\\nEvaluating results¶\\nThe evaluation of a chain, we need to define the data points to be measured. Building Questions and accepted answers is a classical approach.\\nWe can use LLM and a special chain (QAGenerateChain) to build Q&A from a document.\\nAgent¶\\nAgent is an orchestrator pattern where the LLM decides what actions to take from the current query and context. With chain, developer code the sequence of tasks, with agent the LLM decides. LangGraph is an extension of LangChain specifically aimed at creating highly controllable and customizable agents.\\nChains let create a pre-defined sequence of tool usage(s), while Agents let the model uses tools in a loop, so that it can decide how many times to use its defined tools.\\nAgentExecutor is deprecatedUse LangGraph to implement agent.\\nThis content is then from v0.1\\nThere are different types of agent: Intended Model, Supports Chat, Supports Multi-Input Tools, Supports Parallel Function Calling, Required Model Params.\\nLangChain uses a specific Schema model to define: AgentAction, with tool and tool_input and AgentFinish.\\n```\\nfromlangchain.agentsimport create_tool_calling_agent\\nfromlangchain.agentsimport AgentExecutor\\nfromlangchain.tools.retrieverimport create_retriever_tool\\nfromlangchain_community.tools.tavily_searchimport TavilySearchResults\\n...\\ntools = [retriever_tool, search, llm_math, wikipedia]\\nagent = create_tool_calling_agent(llm, tools, prompt)\\nagent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True)\\n```\\n\\nTo create agents use one of the constructor methods such as: create_react_agent, create_json_agent, create_structured_chat_agent, create_tool_calling_agent etc. Those methods return a Runnable.\\nThe Agent loops on user input until it returns AgentFinish action. If the Agent returns an AgentAction, then use that to call a tool and get an Observation. Agent has input and output and intermediate steps. AgentAction is a response that consists of action and action_input.\\nSee the existing predefined agent types.\\n\\nAgentExecutor is the runtime for an agent.\\n\\n\\nTools are functions that an agent can invoke. It defines the input schema for the tool and the function to run. Parameters of the tool should be sensibly named and described.\\n\\n\\nTool Calling¶\\nWith Tool Calling we can define function or tool to be referenced as part of the LLM response, and LLM will prepare the arguments for the function. It is used to generate tool invocations, not to execute it.\\nTool calling allows a model to detect when one or more tools should be called and responds with the inputs that should be passed to those tools. The inputs match a defined schema. Below is an example structured answer from OpenAI LLM: \"tool_calls\" is the key to get the list of function names and arguments the orchestrator needs to call.\\n\"tool_calls\":[\\n{\\n\"name\":\"tavily_search_results_json\",\\n\"args\":{\\n\"query\":\"weather in San Francisco\"\\n},\\n\"id\":\"call_Vg6JRaaz8d06OXbG5Gv7Ea5J\"\\n}\\nPrompt defines placeholders to get tools parameters. The following langchain prompt for OpenAI uses agent_scratchpad variable, which is a MessagesPlaceholder. Intermediate agent actions and tool output messages, will be passed in here.\\nLangChain has a lot of predefined tool definitions to be reused.\\nWe can use tool calling in chain (to use tools in sequence) or in agent (to use tools in loop).\\nLangChain offers an API to the LLM called bind_tools to pass the definition of the tool, as part of each call to the model, so that the application can invoke the tool when appropriate.\\nSee also the load tools api with a list of predefined tools.\\nBelow is the classical application flow using tool calling. The exposed function wraps a remote microservice.\\n\\nWhen developing a solution based on agent, consider the tools, the services, the agent needs to access. See a code example openAI_agent.py.\\nMany LLM providers support for tool calling, including Anthropic, Cohere, Google, Mistral, OpenAI, see the existing LangChain tools.\\nInteresting tools¶\\nSearch recent news¶\\nA common tool integrated in agent, is the Tavily search API, used to get the last trusted News, so the most recent information created after the cutoff date of the LLM.\\nretriever_tool = create_retriever_tool(\\n    retriever,\\n    \"langsmith_search\",\\n    \"Search for information about LangSmith. For any questions about LangSmith, you must use this tool!\",\\n)\\nsearch = TavilySearchResults()\\ntools = [retriever_tool, search]\\nTavilyTavily is the leading search engine optimized for LLMs. It provides factual, explicit and objective answers. It is a GPT researcher which queries, filters and aggregates over 20+ web sources per a single research task. It focuses on optimizing search for AI developers and autonomous AI agents. See this git repo\\nPython REPLtool¶\\nPythonREPLTool is a tool for running python code in REPL (look like a jupiter notebook).\\nA base model¶\\nIt is possible to bind a BaseModel class as below, where a LLM is used to create prompt, so the prompt instruction entity is a json used as tool. (Tool definition are structured system prompt for the LLMs as they just understand text)\\n```\\nclassPromptInstructions(BaseModel):\\n\"\"\"Instructions on how to prompt the LLM.\"\"\"\\n    objective: str\\n    variables: List[str]\\n    constraints: List[str]\\n    requirements: List[str]\\nllm_with_tool = llm.bind_tools([PromptInstructions])\\n```\\nSee the LangGraph sample: prompt_builder_graph.py.\\nOur own tools¶\\nDefine custom tool using the @tool annotation on a function to expose it as a tool. It uses the function name as the tool name and the function’s docstring as the tool’s description.\\nA second approach is to subclass the langchain.pydantic_v1.BaseModel class.\\nFinally the last possible approach is to use StructuredTool dataclass.\\nWhen doing agent we need to manage exception and implement handle_tool_error.\\nTo map the tools to OpenAI function call there is a module called: from langchain_core.utils.function_calling import convert_to_openai_function.\\nIt may be interesting to use embeddings to do tool selection before calling LLM. See this code agent_wt_tool_retrieval.py The approach is to dynamically select the N tools we want at run time, without having to pass all the tool definitions within the context window. It uses a vector store to create embeddings for each tool description.\\nHow Tos¶\\nHow to trace the agent execution?\\nimport langchain\\nlangchain.debug = True\\nOr use LangSmith\\nDefining an agent with tool calling, and the concept of scratchpadDefine an agent with 1/ a user input, 2/ a component for formatting intermediate steps (agent action, tool output pairs) (format_to_openai_tool_messages: convert (AgentAction, tool output) tuples into FunctionMessages), and 3/ a component for converting the output message into an agent action/agent finish:\\n```\\nx is the response from LLM\\nagent = (\\n        {\\n            \"input\": lambda x: x[\"input\"],\\n            \"agent_scratchpad\": lambda x: format_to_openai_tool_messages(\\n                x[\"intermediate_steps\"]\\n            ),\\n             \"chat_history\": lambda x: x[\"chat_history\"],\\n        }\\n        | prompt\\n        | llm_with_tools\\n        | OpenAIToolsAgentOutputParser()\\n    )\\n```\\nOpenAIToolsAgentOutputParser used with OpenAI models, as it relies on the specific tool_calls parameter from OpenAI to convey what tools to use.\\nHow to support streaming the LLM\\'s output?LangChain streaming is needed to make the app more responsive for end-users. All Runnable objects implement a sync method called stream and an async variant called astream. They cut output into chunks and yield them. Recall yield is a generator of data and acts as return. The main demo code is web_server_wt_streaming with the client_stream.py\\nExample of Intended Modelto be done\\nExample of Supports Multi-Input Toolsto be done\\nUse a vector store to keep the list of agent and descriptionAs we cannot put the description of all the tools in the prompt (because of context length issues) so instead we dynamically select the N tools we do want to consider using, at run time. See the code in agent_wt_tool_retrieval.py.\\nLangChain Expression Language (LCEL)¶\\nLCEL supports streaming the LLM results, use async communication, run in parallel, retries and fallbacks, access intermediate results.\\nBack to top\\nPrevious Haystack.aiNext LangGraph\\nCopyright © 2018 - 2024 Jerome Boyer\\nMade with Material for MkDocs\\n'}]"

China’s leaders see artificial intelligence as being the key to upgrading its military strength, solving the problems created by a shrinking workforce, and a source of national pride – especially when Chinese firms manage to circumvent US-led sanctions on core technology. “Applying artificial intelligence to robots basically really kicked into high gear last year,” says Rui Ma, a China technology analyst and investor based in San Francisco. The development of China’s robotics industry is intimately linked to advances in AI.</content></document>', '<document><title>Revisiting The Humanities In The Age Of AI - Forbes</title><url>https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnwerner/2025/04/20/revisiting-the-humanities-in-the-age-of-ai/</url><content>“I do think that AI tools are transforming the opportunities for people in college,” Paul Alivisatos, President of the University of Chicago, said in an interview with Nitin Mittal of Deloitte said at Davos in January. In a piece published at Phys.org, Professor Alexa Joubin at George Washington University discusses AI as a “heuristic tool” for humanities, and talks about how it can change how we think: This new NEH grant program provides up to $750,000 to universities and independent research organizations to support the creation of humanities research centers focusing on the ethical, legal, or societal implications of artificial intelligence.” In talking about this trend and more, Alivisatos suggests that AI is transforming opportunities – not taking them away, but changing the nature of how people innovate and what they do to stand out as humans.</content></document>', '<document><title>Are You At Risk Of AI Agency Decay?

몸에 연료를 공급하고 몸이 기능하는 데 필요한 칼로리와 영양소를 전달한다.\\n\\n식단에 칼로리나 하나 이상의 영양소가 부족하면 건강이 나빠질 수 있다.\\n\\n또한 너무 많은 칼로리를 섭취하면 체중 증가를 경험할 수 있다.\\n\\n비만인 사람들은 제2형 당뇨병, 폐쇄성 수면 무호흡증, 심장, 간, 신장 질환과 같은 질병의 위험이 상당히 증가한다.\\n\\n식단의 질은 질병 위험, 수명 및 정신 건강에 영향을 미친다.\\n\\n초가공 식품이 풍부한 식단은 사망률 증가와 암 및 심장병과 같은 질병의 위험 증가와 관련이 있다.\\n\\n영양이 풍부한 전체 식품으로 구성된 식단은 수명 증가 및 질병 예방과 관련이 있다.\\n\\n고도로 가공된 식품이 풍부한 식단은 특히 운동량이 적은 사람들의 경우 우울 증상의 위험을 증가시킬 수 있다.\\n\\n\\n\\n건강한 식습관 기본\\n\\n건강한 식습관이 왜 중요한지 알았으니 이제 몇 가지 영양 기본 사항에 대해서 알아보자.\\n\\n시작에 앞서, 어떻게 하면 그릇에 따라 영양소를 나눌 수 있는지 아래 유튜브를 참고하자.\\n\\n\\n\\n영양소 밀도\\n\\n건강한 식단을 생각할 때 칼로리에 관한 것일 수 있다.\\n\\n칼로리도 중요하지만 주요 관심사는 영양소인 게 중요하다.\\n\\n단백질, 탄수화물, 지방, 비타민 및 미네랄을 포함하여 영양소가 몸이 번성하는 데 필요한 것이다.\\n\\n영양소 밀도는 식품이 제공하는 칼로리와 관련하여 식품에 포함된 영양소 양을 말한다.\\n\\n음식이 칼로리가 높다고 해서 그것이 나쁘다는 것을 의미하는 것이 아니다.\\n\\n음식 선택이 칼로리에만 기반한다면 건강한 식습관을 놓치고 있는 것이다.\\n\\n일반적으로 단백질, 섬유질, 건강한 지방, 비타민 및 미네랄과 같은 영양소가 풍부한 음식을 섭취하자.\\n\\n이러한 음식에는 채소, 과일, 견과류, 씨앗, 콩, 기름진 생선 및 계란이 포함된다.\\n\\n종합비타민 추천 순위 TOP16(2023년)도 참고해도 좋다.\\n\\n\\n\\n다양성\\n\\n다양한 음식을 먹는 것을 의미하는 식이 다양성이다.\\n\\n다양한 종류의 음식이 풍부한 식단을 따르면 장내 박테리아를 지원하고 건강한 체중을 촉진하며 만성 질환으로부터 보호한다.\\n\\n그래도 편식하는 사람이라면 다양한 음식을 먹는 것이 어려울 수 있다.\\n\\n한 번에 하나씩 새로운 음식을 먹어보자.\\n\\n연구에 따르면 음식에 더 많이 노출될수록 음식에 익숙해질 가능성이 더 커진다.\\n\\n\\n\\n다량 영양소 비율\\n\\n음식에서 얻는 주요 영양소인 다량 영양소는 탄수화물, 지방 및 단백질이다.\\n\\n일반적으로 식사와 간식은 세 가지 사이에서 균형을 이루어야 한다.\\n\\n특히, 섬유질이 풍부한 탄수화물 공급원에 단백질과 지방을 첨가하면 요리가 더 포만감 있고 맛있어진다.\\n\\n식단이 항상 균형을 이루지 않아도 괜찮다.\\n\\n개인에 따라 다르게 섭취해도 괜찮다.\\n\\n\\n\\n초가공 식품\\n\\n식단을 개선하는 가장 좋은 방법 중 하나는 초가공 식품을 줄이는 것이다.\\n\\n가공식품을 완전히 피할 필요는 없다.\\n\\n사실, 껍질을 벗긴 견과류, 통조림 콩, 냉동 과일 및 채소와 같은 건강식품은 이런저런 방식으로 가공된다.\\n\\n탄산음료, 제과류, 사탕, 설탕이 들어간 시리얼 식품은 영양분이 전혀 포함이 안되어 있다.\\n\\n이러한 음식은 우울증, 심장 질환, 비만 및 기타 여러 합병증의 위험이 더 큰 것으로 나타났다.\\n\\n반면에 이러한 음식이 적고 영양이 풍부한 전체 음식이 많은 식단은 반대 효과가 있어 질병을 예방하고 수명을 연장하며 전반적인 신체적 정신적 웰빙을 촉진한다.\\n\\n따라서 영양이 풍부한 식품, 특히 야채와 과일을 우선적으로 섭취하는 것이 가장 좋다.\\n\\n\\n\\n특정 음식과 음료를 줄여야 할까?\\n\\n건강한 식단에서는 특정 음식을 제한하는 것이 가장 좋다.\\n\\n연구에 따르면 초가공 식품이 질병 위험 증가 및 조기 사망을 포함한 부정적인 건강 결과와 관련이 있었다.\\n\\n탄산음료, 가공육, 사탕, 아이스크림, 튀긴 음식, 패스트푸드, 포장 스낵을 줄이는 것은 건강을 개선하고 특정 질병의 위험을 낮추는 가장 현명한 방법이다.\\n\\n대신 야채, 과일, 견과류, 씨앗, 콩, 생선과 같이 영양이 풍부한 전체 식품에 우선순위를 두고 고도로 가공된 식품과 음료는 피하자.\\n\\n아이스크림과 사탕과 같은 음식은 건강하고 균형 잡힌 식단의 일부가 될 수 있지만 칼로리 섭취의 중요한 부분이 돼서는 안 된다.\\n\\n\\n\\n메뉴 추천\\n\\n식사를 준비하거나 요리하는 데 몇 시간을 소비하는 것은 의미 없다.\\n\\n잘 갖춰진 주방은 건강한 식사와 간식을 훨씬 쉽게 선택할 수 있다.\\n\\n대표적인 메뉴 추천은

잡힌 식단을 짤 때 주의해야 할 점\\n\\n균형 잡힌 식단을 구성할 때는 다양한 영양소와 식품군을 고려하여 조합하는 것이 중요합니다.\\n\\n아래는 균형 잡힌 식단을 짤 때 고려해야 할 중요한 요소들입니다: 1. 다양한 영양소 제공: 단백질, 탄수화물, 지방, 비타민, 미네랄, 식이섬유 등 다양한 영양소를 포함하는 식품을 조합하여 영양 다양성을 유지하세요. 2. 영양소 밸런스: 각각의 영양소가 적절한 비율로 공급되도록 조절해야 합니다. 너무 과도한 섭취나 부족한 섭취를 피하도록 식단을 구성하세요. 3. 프로틴 공급: 단백질은 근육 유지와 성장에 중요합니다. 다양한 소스에서 단백질을 섭취하여 필요한 아미노산을 얻을 수 있도록 신경 써주세요. 4. 탄수화물 제한: 탄수화물은 에너지원이지만 과도한 섭취는 체중 증가를 유발할 수 있습니다. 곡물, 채소, 과일 등 복합탄수화물을 선호하세요. 5. 좋은 지방 선택: 포화지방과 트랜스지방을 제한하고, 단일/다일빈도 불포화지방 (올리브 오일, 견과류, 아보카도)을 섭취하세요. 6. 채소와 과일 섭취: 다양한 색깔의 채소와 과일을 섭취하여 비타민, 미네랄, 식이섬유를 공급하세요. 7. 소금과 음식 조절: 소금과 음식의 조리법을 조절하여 과도한 나트륨 섭취를 피하고, 가공 식품 섭취를 줄이세요. 8. 수분 섭취: 물, 무가당 차, 식물성 우유 등을 통해 수분 섭취를 유지하세요. 9. 개인적인 요구에 맞추기: 개인의 건강 상태, 활동 수준, 신체 조건 등을 고려하여 식단을 조절하세요. 10. 적당한 식사 간격: 규칙적인 식사 간격을 유지하여 혈당 조절과 에너지 공급을 안정적으로 유지하세요. 균형 잡힌 식단을 구성하면서도 개인의 필요와 식습관에 맞게 조절하는 것이 중요합니다.\\n\\n가능한 신선한 식재료를 활용하고, 다양한 요리법을 통해 맛과 영양을 즐기면서 건강한 식단을 유지할 수 있을 것입니다.\\n\\n\\n\\n다이어트 식단이 궁금하시다면 아래 글을 참고해보세요!\\n\\n다이어트 할 때 주의할 점! 다이어트

      "A neo-classical painting depicting a group of people engaging with smartphones, set in a grand, classical environment reminiscent of ancient Greece. The individuals are dressed in elegant, flowing robes similar to those worn in classical art, embodying ideals of beauty and harmony. They are standing in a lush garden with marble statues and ornate fountains in the background. The expressions on their faces reflect a mix of fascination and distraction as they gaze at their devices, contrasting the timeless beauty of their surroundings with modern technology. Soft, dramatic lighting enhances the scene, creating a sense of depth and highlighting the juxtaposition of past and present. The overall composition should evoke a sense of irony, inviting viewers to reflect on the relationship between humanity and technology in a classical artistic style.\n"
