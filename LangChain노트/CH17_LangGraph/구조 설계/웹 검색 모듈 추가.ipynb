      "U.S. stocks rallied on Wednesday, one day after President Donald Trump said tariffs on China would \"come down substantially.\"\n",
      "Trump also appeared to soften previous attacks on the Federal Reserve, saying late Tuesday he has \"no intention\" of firing top central banker Jerome Powell.\n",
      "In public remarks on Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the U.S. is willing to negotiate with China, which sent markets higher. The comments from Bessent affirmed a shift toward de-escalation he reportedly shared at a private JPMorgan event a day earlier. Bloomberg News first reported those remarks.\n",
      "\"There is an opportunity for a big deal here,\" Bessent told an audience at the Institute of International Finance in Washington, D.C. \"If they want to rebalance, let's do it together.\"\n",

      "Shares of electric carmaker Tesla surged 6% in the first trading since CEO Elon Musk said his time devoted to the Department of Government Efficiency would \"drop significantly\" next month, paving the way for his return to the company. Still, Tesla shares have fallen by nearly half since a December peak.\n",
      "Musk described his work at DOGE as necessary, but he said that \"working for the government to get the financial house in order is mostly done.\"\n",
      "The uptick also took hold at the other so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" tech giants, which drove much of the gains in the S&P 500 over recent years.\n",

      "Earlier this month, Trump hiked tariffs on Chinese goods to a total of 145%, prompting China to respond with 125% levies on U.S. products.\n",

      "\"145% is very high and it won’t be that high,\" Trump told reporters at the White House late Tuesday. \"It won’t be anywhere near that high. It’ll come down substantially. But it won’t be zero.\"\n",

      "Illinois Sen. Richard Durbin is retiring at the end of next year after more than four decades in Washington in a move that also will set off a leadership fight among his colleagues in the Senate Democratic caucus.\n",
      "\"The decision of whether to run for re-election has not been easy. I truly love the job of being a United States Senator. But in my heart, I know it’s time to pass the torch,\" the 80-year-old Durbin said in a video posted on April 23 to social media.\n",
      "Durbin, the longtime second-ranking Democrat in the Senate, was elected to serve in the U.S. Senate in 1996 after spending 14 years in the House. He is the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., commented swiftly on the announcement.\n",
      "\"Dick Durbin has been more than a colleague – he’s been a trusted partner, one of the most respected voices in the Senate for decades, my dear friend, and, of course, my former roommate,\" Schumer said in a statement, referencing the storied Capitol Hill row house that inspired a Web TV show by Doonesbury cartoonist Garry Trudeau.\n",
      "Durbin's retirement leaves an opening in Senate Democratic leadership at a time when the party is searching for new leaders to chart its direction in the wake of the 2024 presidential election, when Republicans kept control of the House and flipped the Senate and White House.\n",
      "Senators who may put their hat in the ring include Brian Schatz of Hawaii and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who hold other positions in Senate Democratic leadership, and Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democrat on the powerful Appropriations Committee. Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Cory Booker of New Jersey have also positioned themselves as potential next-generation leaders in the chamber.\n",
      "Durbin's announcement also kicks off a competitive race among Illinois Democrats seeking to succeed him in the Senate. Potential candidates include Reps. Raja Krishnamoorthi, Robin Kelly and Lauren Underwood, and Illinois Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton.\n",
      "While the Illinois Senate seat is likely to stay in Democratic hands given the state's leftward tilt, Durbin is the fourth Senate Democrat to announce he would not be running for re-election in 2026. New contenders now stand a chance at an open seat in 2026 in Illinois, Minnesota, New Hampshire and Michigan.\n",
      "A legacy of advocacy, mentorship\n",
      "Over nearly three decades in the U.S. Senate, Durbin built a reputation as a passionate advocate for Illinois and as a mentor within the Democratic party.\n",
      "As the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, he has made criminal justice one of his signature issues. He played a key role in reaching a bipartisan compromise in 2018 on the First Step Act, which had been years in the making.\n",
      "The measure was the first major criminal justice overhaul in decades and aimed at reducing the number of inmates in the nation’s crowded prisons by giving judges more discretion in sentencing offenders for nonviolent crimes, particularly drug offenses, and bolstering rehabilitation programs for former prisoners.\n",
      "Durbin told USA TODAY in 2018 that his drive to change the system came, in part, from what he called the “worst votes I ever cast.”\n",
      "In the House, he backed a measure in 1986 that led to tougher sentences for crack dealers than for those trafficking cocaine. The measure was condemned for its disproportionate impact on African Americans, who were more likely to possess crack than the more expensive cocaine. He pledged to try to fix the law.\n",
      "Durbin has also been a longtime advocate of legislation to protect undocumented people who were brought to the United States as children, known as Dreamers.\n",
      "Durbin also played a crucial role as a mentor to up-and-coming Democrats seeking higher office.\n",
      "He met Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., when she was an Army National Guard Blackhawk helicopter pilot in 2005, three months after she had lost her legs in combat.\n",
      "Durbin encouraged her to get involved in politics, first as an official in the state and federal Veterans Affairs agencies, and later as she ran for House and Senate. \"He saw a Soldier in search of her next mission,\" Duckworth wrote on X.\n",
      "Durbin was a friend and mentor to President Barack Obama, who was only four years into his first Senate term when he successfully ran for president in 2008.\n",
      "And he was a fierce advocate for Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson during her confirmation process in 2022. She is the first Black woman to serve as a U.S. Supreme Court Justice.\n",

      "DATAW ISLAND, S.C. (AP) — Republican Rep. Nancy Mace faced criticism over the legal wrangling concerning universities and allegations of antisemitism during a town hall at a private, gated island community in her coastal South Carolina district.\n",
      "The crowd of several hundred, mostly gray-haired attendees on Dataw Island was primarily friendly, with a moderator asking pre-screened questions of Mace on stage. A small group of attendees did walk out after Mace talked about Jewish college students being mistreated by campus protesters, an issue that has become a flashpoint in the Trump administration’s feud with institutions of higher learning.\n",
      "That includes Harvard University, which this week filed suit to halt a federal freeze on more than $2.2 billion in grants after the institution said it would defy the Trump administration’s demands, which include limiting activism on campus. The administration has argued universities allowed antisemitism to go unchecked at campus protests against Israel’s war in Gaza\n",
      "“I support all Jews in Israel, thank you very much,” Mace said. “They are our best friend, and Christians are in their fight with them. I support them 100%, and it says a lot about the folks walking out of here, when I’m talking about protesting Jews and religion.”\n",

      "Harvard's federal funding under review by Trump administration\n",
      "Trump administration halts dozens of research grants at Princeton University\n",
      "The conversation later turned back to federal funding for colleges, including Harvard, with Mace saying she supported efforts to rein in schools that are “raising lunatics.”\n",
      "“We don’t like the antisemitism on their campus,” Mace said. “They shouldn’t get any federal funding.”\n",
      "Mace has often invited confrontation, posting to her social media videos of conflicts with protesters and people who come to her events. As she drove to the Dataw Island event, she posted a video of herself on social media, waving at people gathered to protest her appearance.\n",
      "Wednesday’s RSVP-only event was hosted by the Dataw Island Owners Association, and questions were submitted to a moderator in advance. According to Dataw Island’s website, the 870-acre property, about 6 miles (9.66 kilometers) east of Beaufort, boasts 36 holes of golf, a private marina, a 25,000 square-foot clubhouse and about 1,100 homesites, with completed homes ranging above $2 million.\n",
      "Even small confrontations over President Donald Trump’s priorities may serve to help boost Mace’s conservative bona fides as she looks to broaden her electoral portfolio. Elected in November to her third term representing the state’s only swing district, which includes the Charleston area, Mace told The Associated Press in January that she is “seriously considering” a run for governor in 2026.\n",
      "Since first winning the South Carolina GOP presidential primary in 2016, Trump has remained popular in the state, although Mace’s district is the only one he didn’t win as he sought the 2024 Republican nomination. In that contest, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley — who also served as Trump’s United Nations ambassador — bested her former boss in the 1st District but lost the state as a whole.\n",
      "Going on to win the nomination and the general election, Trump also backed Mace in her own campaign last year, and she has said she plans to seek his support in future campaigns.\n",
      "Mace’s district is the only one in South Carolina to have switched party control in recent decades. The 1st District, which spans South Carolina’s southeastern coast in what’s known as the Lowcountry, was held by a Democrat for a single term until Mace won it back for Republicans in 2020.\n",
      "Mace introduced a resolution banning transgender women from using women’s bathrooms at the U.S. Capitol or House office buildings, targeting a key issue among social conservatives that could also boost her profile statewide. In her interview with The AP, Mace acknowledged she needs to spend more time with South Carolina voters in more conservative areas like the Upstate region.\n",
      "The tenor of Mace’s event differed dramatically from a forum hosted earlier Wednesday by Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, who faced heated questions about Trump’s first few months in office. The room of about 100 people in north-central Worth County, near the Minnesota border, peppered Grassley with questions about mass deportations, including Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s, billionaire Elon Musk and cuts to the federal workforce and tariffs.\n",
