For example, it was shown that even\\ndemonstrations with invalid reasoning can lead to\\nsimilar performance compared to valid demonstra-\\ntions (Wang et al., 2023)2. Hence, it is not clear\\nhow language models learn to reason effectively\\nbased on the chain-of-thought demonstrations. On\\nthe other hand, mistakes in the intermediate steps\\ncan compound and derail the reasoning process\\n2Note that while chain-of-thought can be performed in\\na zero-shot fashion with prompts, we focus on the few-shot\\nsetting, as it was originally proposed in Wei et al. (2022b).\\narXiv:2311.09277v1  [cs.CL]  15 Nov 2023\\n(Ling et al., 2023). Any potential error in the rea-\\nsoning process not only affects the accuracy of the\\nfinal result but also undermines the trustworthiness\\nof the language model (Turpin et al., 2023). Thus,\\nit is also important to reduce mistakes in intermedi-\\nate reasoning steps.\\nTo address the challenges of chain of thought,\\nwe are inspired by how humans can learn from pos-\\nitive as well as negative examples. For instance,\\nwhen solving a complex task where the intermedi-\\nate steps are not well-defined, it is useful to learn\\nthe correct steps from positive demonstrations, as\\nwell as avoiding faults in negative demonstrations.\\nHence, we propose contrastive chain of thought,\\nwhich provides both positive and negative demon-\\nstrations to enhance the reasoning of language mod-\\nels. Naturally, this raises the question of how to\\ndesign effective negative demonstrations, as well\\nas whether they can be generalized to diverse tasks.\\nThrough our analysis of multiple invalid reasoning\\ntypes, we design a simple and effective method\\nthat can automatically generate contrastive demon-\\nstrations from existing valid reasoning chains. Fur-\\nthermore, as contrastive chain-of-thought is task-\\nagnostic and compatible with methods such as self-\\nconsistency (Wang et al., 2022), we believe that\\nit can serve as a general enhancement of chain of\\nthought.\\nTo measure the effectiveness of contrastive chain\\nof thought, we present evaluations on a wide range\\nof reasoning benchmarks, and find significant ben-\\nefits. Notably, compared to conventional chain of\\nthought, we observe improvements of 9.8 and 16.0\\npoints for GSM-8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) and Bam-\\nboogle (Press et al., 2023) respectively when using\\nGPT-3.5-Turbo3, a widely used LLM. Further anal-\\nysis of the reasoning chains generated from our\\nmethod also shows significant reduction in errors.\\nIn summary, our main contributions include: (1)\\nWe analyse various invalid reasoning types and\\nfind that combining positive and negative demon-\\nstrations generally boost the effectiveness of chain-\\nof-thought. (2) Based on the analysis above, we\\npropose contrastive chain of thought to enhance lan-\\nguage model reasoning. To improve generalization,\\nwe also propose an automatic method to construct\\ncontrastive demonstrations. (3) Evaluations on mul-\\ntiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate significant\\nimprovements compared to conventional chain of\\nthought.\\n3https://platform.openai.com/docs/models\\n2\\nPreliminary Study: Effect of Different\\nTypes of Contrastive Demonstrations\\nWhile chain of thought (CoT) prompting has en-\\nhanced the reasoning of large language models, it\\nremains less well understood. For instance, while\\nsound reasoning seems intuitively important to ef-\\nfective chain of thought, previous work has shown\\nthat there is little effect when using invalid demon-\\nstrations. On the other hand, previous works in\\ncontrastive learning (Khosla et al., 2020) and align-\\nment (Ouyang et al., 2022) have demonstrated how\\nlanguage models can learn more effectively from\\nboth valid and invalid examples. Hence, we con-\\nduct a preliminary study with the following re-\\nsearch question: Can invalid reasoning demon-\\nstrations be instead used to enhance chain of\\nthought? Specifically, we aim to study the effect\\nof providing chain-of-thought demonstrations in a\\n“contrastive” manner, i.e., demonstrations contain-\\ning both valid and invalid rationales.\\n2.1\\nComponents of Chain of Thought\\nCompared to standard prompting with in-context\\ndemonstrations (Brown et al., 2020), chain-of-\\nthought (CoT) prompting (Wei et al., 2022b) in-\\ncludes a rationale for each demonstration example.\\nEach rationale consists of a series of intermedi-\\nate reasoning steps, guiding the language model to\\nsolve tasks in a step-by-step manner. Following the\\nformulation of (Wang et al., 2023), we identify two\\ndistinct components of each CoT rationale:\\n• Bridging objects are the symbolic items that\\nthe model traverses in order to reach the final\\nsolution. For example, the objects could be\\nnumbers and equations in arithmetic tasks, or\\nthe names of entities in factual tasks.\\n• Language templates are the textual hints that\\nguide the language model to derive and con-\\ntextualize the correct bridging objects during\\nthe reasoning process.\\n2.2\\nWhat is Invalid Chain of Thought?\\nGiven the distinct components of chain of thought,\\nwe are now able to systematically identify the as-\\npects which lead to invalid rationales. Concretely\\nthere are two main aspects which are applicable to\\nboth the language and object components:\\n• Coherence refers to the correct ordering of\\nsteps in a rationale, and is necessary for suc-\\ncessful chain of thought. Specifically, as chain\\nPrompting\\nMethod\\nArithmetic Reasoning Example\\nQuestion: Leah had 32 chocolates and her sister had 42. \\nIf they ate 35, how many pieces do they have left in total?\\nFactual Reasoning Example\\nQuestion: Who is the grandchild of Dambar Shah?\\nStandard\\nAnswer: 39\\nAnswer: Rudra Shah\\nChain-of-Thought \\n(CoT)\\nStep-by-step answer: Originally, Leah had 32 chocolates \\nand her sister had 42.

(2023), we\\ninclude invalid reasoning as a category of invalid\\nchain of thought, which is neither incoherent nor\\nirrelevant, but contains logical mistakes. Hence,\\nwe aim to study the five main categories of invalid\\nchain-of-thought, as shown in Figure 2.\\n2.3\\nExperimental Setup\\nTo conduct the experiments for the preliminary\\nstudy, we leverage the GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021)\\nand Bamboogle (Press et al., 2023) datasets for\\narithmetic and factual reasoning respectively.

This suggests that\\nlanguage models are better able to learning step-\\nby-step reasoning when provided with both valid\\nand invalid rationales. Hence, we believe that con-\\ntrastive demonstrations have the potential to greatly\\nenhance language model reasoning ability.\\n3\\nContrastive Chain of Thought\\nChain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, as evidenced\\nby prior research, has indeed elevated the reasoning\\ncapabilities of large language models (Wei et al.,\\n2022b). However, a comprehensive understand-\\ning of this phenomenon is still lacking. Although\\nlogically sound reasoning appears to be inherently\\ncrucial for chain of thought, prior studies surpris-\\ningly reveal minimal impact when employing in-\\nvalid demonstrations. To this end, based on our\\npreliminary study in Section 2, we found that pro-\\nviding both valid and invalid reasoning demonstra-\\ntions in a “contrastive” manner greatly improves\\nreasoning performance. However, this approach\\nmay not generalize well to new tasks, as it requires\\nmanual construction of the invalid rationales.\\nThus, we propose a general prompting method\\nknown as contrastive chain of thought, which\\nincludes automatic construction of contrastive\\ndemonstrations. Figure 3 presents an overview of\\nour approach. Specifically, the language model is\\nprovided with the question, ground truth answer ex-\\nplanation and incorrect answer explanation. Com-\\npared to standard prompting, our method enables\\nmodels to perform more complex reasoning by de-\\ncomposing problems into intermediate steps. Com-\\npared to conventional chain-of-thought prompting,\\nour method contrasts the valid and invalid answer\\nexplanations, guiding the model to generate more\\naccurate reasoning chains.\\nConcretely, given a small set of n in-context\\ndemonstration examples D = {E1, . . . , E|n|}, and\\na query Q, the goal of the model is to generate a\\nsuitable answer A. For standard prompting, the\\ndemonstration examples consist of just the ques-\\ntion and answer, i.e., Ej = (Qj, Aj).

As shown in the figure above,\\nthe reasoning steps T typically consist of multi-\\nple sentences where each sentence describes one\\nreasoning step. Hence, chain-of-thought prompt-\\ning examples consist of the question, reasoning\\nsteps, and final answer, i.e., Ej = (Qj, Tj, Aj).\\nHowever, the model does not know what faults\\nto avoid in conventional chain-of-thought, which\\ncould lead to increased mistakes and error prop-\\nagation. Hence, our contrastive chain of thought\\nmethod provides both the correct and incorrect rea-\\nsoning steps in the demonstration examples, i.e.,\\nEj = (Qj, Tj,+, Aj,+, Tj,−, Aj,−).\\nTo obtain the correct reasoning steps T+ for the\\ndemonstration examples, we use the annotated ex-\\namples from the previous chain-of-thought works.\\nFor the incorrect reasoning steps T−, we automati-\\ncally construct it from the correct reasoning steps\\nT+, based on the \"Incoherent Objects\" category in\\nSection 2. Concretely, we use an existing entity\\nrecognition model5 to extract the object spans such\\nas numbers, equations, or persons from a given\\nchain-of-thought rationale. Consequently, we ran-\\ndomly shuffle the position of the objects within the\\nrationale, thus constructing a rationale with inco-\\nherent bridging objects. Note that when testing\\nwith a new question, only the question and demon-\\nstration examples are provided to the model, and\\nthe model must generate its own reasoning steps\\n5https://spacy.io/models/en#en_core_web_trf\\nbefore producing the final answer.\\n4\\nExperiments\\n4.1\\nExperimental Setup\\nWe focus our study on two main types of reasoning\\ntasks: arithmetic reasoning and factual question\\nanswering (QA). For arithmetic reasoning, we con-\\nduct experiments on a range of datasets including\\nGSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), AQuA (Ling et al.,\\n2017), GSM-Hard (Gao et al., 2023), SVAMP (Pa-\\ntel et al., 2021), and ASDIV (Miao et al., 2020).\\nFor factual QA, we include two datasets: Bam-\\nboogle (Press et al., 2023) and StrategyQA (Geva\\net al., 2021). To maintain a reasonable computing\\nbudget, we limit each dataset to a maximum of\\n500 test samples through random sampling. For\\ndatasets that contain less than 500 test samples, we\\ninstead use all available test samples. The datasets’\\ndetails are included in Table 3. Regarding model\\nand prompting details, we use the same experimen-\\ntal setup as for our preliminary study in Section\\n2.\\n4.2\\nMain Results\\nTo assess the effectiveness of our method, we eval-\\nuate on several reasoning tasks and report the main\\nresults in Table 2. Our main findings are as follows:\\nContrastive CoT demonstrates consistent im-\\nprovements\\nover\\nconventional\\nCoT.\\nCon-\\ntrastive CoT consistently outperforms conventional\\nCoT across the datasets in both arithmetic and fac-\\ntual reasoning categories. Notably, we observe\\nsubstantial gains of more than 10 points on GSM-\\nHard, SVAMP, ASDIV, Bamboogle and Strate-\\ngyQA. Thus, the consistent and significant perfor-\\nmance improvements demonstrate the general ef-\\nfectiveness of our proposed method. As contrastive\\nchain of thought can be automatically constructed\\nfrom existing rationales, the annotation cost is the\\nsame as conventional chain of thought. Hence, it\\ncan be viewed as a general enhancement of chain\\nof thought.\\nContrastive CoT is more effective when ap-\\nplied with self-consistency.\\nAs self-consistency\\n(Wang et al., 2022) is a popular decoding strategy\\nto boost the chain-of-thought performance of large\\nlanguage models, we are interested to see if con-\\ntrastive chain of thought can benefit similarly from\\nself-consistency. In general, we observe that self-\\nconsistency further enhances the performance of\\ncontrastive CoT. This enhancement is particularly\\nevident in the case of the AQuA dataset. While con-\\ntrastive CoT alone results in a modest performance\\nimprovement of 4.0%, applying self-consistency\\namplifies this gain significantly, achieving an addi-\\ntional improvement of 14.2%.\\n5\\nRelated Work\\nLarge Language Models\\nRecent developments\\nin large language models have shown that mas-\\nsively scaling the size and training data of models\\ncan greatly improve generalization (Kaplan et al.,\\n2020). Notably, large language models have been\\nshown to generalize to new tasks when given suit-\\nable prompts and demonstrations (Brown et al.,\\n2020). This has brought about a new paradigm of\\nleveraging language models for tasks without the\\nneed for additional training (Liu et al., 2023). How-\\never, simply scaling language models has not been\\nsufficient to attain good performance on challeng-\\ning tasks such as arithmetic reasoning and factual\\nquestion answering (Wei et al., 2022b). Hence, in\\nthis work, we focus on enhancing the reasoning\\nability of large language models through prompts.\\nChain of Thought\\nChain-of-thought prompting\\nwas introduced by Wei et al. (2022b) to enhance\\nlanguage model reasoning by generating interme-\\ndiate steps. Notably, this has inspired numerous\\nworks that build upon this direction of step-by-\\nstep reasoning. For instance, automatic chain-of-\\nthought (Zhang et al., 2023) was proposed to ad-\\ndress the challenges in manually annotating chain-\\nof-thought demonstrations. On the other hand, it\\nwas shown that specific prompts such as “Let’s\\nthink step-by-step” can enable language models\\nto perform chain-of-thought in a zero-shot man-\\nner, without any demonstrations (Kojima et al.,\\n2022). In addition, challenging problems can be de-\\ncomposed into multiple sub-problems (Zhou et al.,\\n2023), or even into code programs that can be au-\\ntomatically executed (Gao et al., 2023). Despite\\nthe progress in chain-of-thought on multiple fronts,\\nwe still lack a rigorous understanding of the under-\\nlying mechanism (Turpin et al., 2023; Feng et al.,\\n2023). In this work, inspired by the findings of pre-\\nvious works regarding invalid demonstrations, we\\npropose contrastive chain-of-thought to enhance\\nlanguage model reasoning. As contrastive chain-\\nof-thought leverages both valid and invalid reason-\\ning demonstrations, we believe this may encour-\\nage other researchers to fundamentally rethink the\\nchain-of-thought process.\\nLearning from Negative Examples\\nWhile\\nchain-of-thought prompting typically involves only\\nvalid demonstrations, it is not clear whether in-\\nvalid demonstrations can also benefit the reason-\\ning process (Wang et al., 2023).\\nOn the other\\nhand, learning from negative or invalid samples\\nis not new. For instance, contrastive learning is\\na well-established deep learning approach that en-\\ncourages models to distinguish between “positive”\\nand “negative” samples, thus learning better rep-\\nresentations (Khosla et al., 2020). Similarly, rein-\\nforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)\\ntrains a reward model based on positive and neg-\\native samples of human preference data (Ouyang\\net al., 2022; Christiano et al., 2017). Hence, in-\\nspired by the previous approaches, we propose con-\\ntrastive chain-of-thought, a general enhancement\\nof chain-of-thought prompting, by enabling mod-\\nels to learn from both valid and invalid reasoning\\ndemonstrations.\\n6\\nConclusions\\nIn this work, we have explored the effect of leverag-\\ning invalid reasoning demonstrations for enhancing\\nchain of thought. Through our preliminary study\\non different invalid chain-of-thought categories, we\\nfound that providing both valid and invalid demon-\\nstrations in a contrastive manner greatly improves\\nreasoning ability in language models. To overcome\\nthe challenge of manually annotating invalid ratio-\\nnales, we propose contrastive chain of thought, a\\ngeneral prompting method which can automatically\\nconstruct contrastive demonstrations from existing\\nrationales. Through experiments on several reason-\\ning tasks, we find contrastive chain of thought to be\\na general enhancement of chain-of-thought prompt-\\ning. Further investigation into alternative forms of\\nchain-of-thought prompting will hopefully inspire\\nfuture advancements in language-based reasoning.\\nReferences\\nTom Brown, Benjamin Mann, Nick Ryder, Melanie\\nSubbiah, Jared D Kaplan, Prafulla Dhariwal, Arvind\\nNeelakantan, Pranav Shyam, Girish Sastry, Amanda\\nAskell, Sandhini Agarwal, Ariel Herbert-Voss,\\nGretchen Krueger, Tom Henighan, Rewon Child,\\nAditya Ramesh, Daniel Ziegler, Jeffrey Wu, Clemens\\nWinter, Chris Hesse, Mark Chen, Eric Sigler, Ma-\\nteusz Litwin, Scott Gray, Benjamin Chess, Jack\\nClark, Christopher Berner, Sam McCandlish, Alec\\nRadford, Ilya Sutskever, and Dario Amodei. 2020.\\nLanguage models are few-shot learners.\\nIn Ad-\\nvances in Neural Information Processing Systems,\\nvolume 33, pages 1877–1901.

Human thinking is often characterized by\\nits ability to make sudden leaps and connections\\nbetween seemingly unrelated ideas, which can lead\\nto novel insights and solutions. This non-linear,\\njumping thought process is a hallmark of human\\ncreativity, reasoning, and problem-solving abilities.\\nHowever, it also poses a significant challenge for\\ncognitive modeling and understanding.\\nRecently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have\\nbeen advancing at an unprecedented pace. With\\nthe emergence of breakthroughs such as GPT-\\n3 (Brown et al., 2020), PaLM (Chowdhery et al.,\\n2022), and GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), the field of\\nnatural language processing has entered a new\\nera of possibilities. Recent studies (Wei et al.,\\n2022a; Wang et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022) have\\nshown that the reasoning ability of LLMs can be\\nunlocked by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting.\\nCoT prompting involves a series of intermediate\\nnatural language rationales that lead to the final\\nanswer. In addition, Zhang et al. (2023) have in-\\ntroduced Multimodal-CoT, which combines both\\nlanguage and visual modalities to help surpass the\\nlimitations of textual information. More detailed\\nrelated works can be found in Appendix A.\\nPrevious works on Chain-of-Thought (CoT)\\nprompting, which have been limited to textual and\\nvisual information, often represented the human\\nreasoning process as sequential thought chains.\\nThis approach overlooks the modeling of humans’\\njumping thought process and neglects to incorpo-\\nrate the complex structural information of reason-\\ning thoughts into the model.\\nConcurrent work\\nTree-of-thoughts (ToT) (Yao et al., 2023) divides\\nthoughts into thought units and models them as a\\ntree-like search process.\\nNevertheless, human cognition transcends this\\ntree structure, exhibiting intricate graph-like for-\\nmations.

Therefore, we aim to enable the concur-\\nrent assimilation of linear and nonlinear cognitive\\nprocesses, surpassing the mere generation of seg-\\nmented thought units. To address the above limi-\\ntation, different from ToT, we propose the Graph-\\nof-Thought (GoT), a novel approach to modeling\\nhuman thought processes not only as a chain but\\nalso as a graph. Our method is based on the assump-\\ntion that the human mind works by connecting and\\nrecombining ideas in a non-sequential, graph fash-\\nion, rather than following a strict sequential chain.\\nBy representing thought units as nodes and connec-\\ntions between thoughts as edges, GoT captures the\\nrich, non-sequential nature of human thinking and\\nallows for a more realistic and logical modeling of\\nreasoning processes.\\nAn example of GoT reasoning is shown in Fig-\\nure 1. Inspired by Multimodal-CoT (Zhang et al.,\\n2023), we have adopted a two-stage reasoning\\nframework. It first generates rationales and then\\ngenerates the final answer based on the predicted ra-\\ntionales. In addition to text features, graph features\\nof GoT are integrated during the rationale genera-\\ntion and answer inference. Specifically, GoT is first\\nconstructed with an Extract-Cluster-Coreference\\n(ECC) process, which simulates the deductive pro-\\ncess in human reasoning. We have used T5 (Raffel\\net al., 2020a) pre-trained language model as our\\nbackbone model. GoT is encoded with a graph\\nattention network and then fused with the original\\nrepresentation via a gated fusion network.\\nFurthermore, we have also presented a multi-\\nmodal GoT, which integrates not only text features\\nand GoT features but also visual features. For our\\nexperiments, we have used both FLAN-Alpaca\\n1 (T5)-base and FLAN-Alpaca (T5)-large as our\\nbackbone models.\\nWe implement GoT as a two-stage framework\\nand fine-tuning language models and integrating\\ntext, thought graph, and vision features for a more\\nrealistic and accurate reasoning process.\\nGoT\\ndemonstrates exceptional performance on both text-\\nonly AQUA-RAT (Ling et al., 2017) and multi-\\nmodal ScienceQA (Lu et al., 2022) benchmarks,\\nsurpassing the accuracy of online system Chat-\\nGPT (OpenAI, 2023) by 9.28%, strong baseline\\nMultimodal-CoT (Zhang et al., 2023) by 2.40%,\\nand even exceeding human performance, establish-\\ning a new state-of-the-art on ScienceQA test set\\nwith far fewer parameters.\\n2\\nGraph-of-Thought\\nThe overview of our proposed GoT can be seen\\nin Figure 2.

Therefore, GoT employs inde-\\npendent encoders to encode input data for each\\nmodality. We use a Transformer encoder to encode\\ninput text, a vision encoder to encode an image, and\\na graph attention network to encode the thought\\ngraph. The encoded features are further passed\\ninto cross-attention to align text tokens with image\\npatches and graph nodes, respectively. We then\\nuse a gated fusion layer to fuse these three features\\nfurther and pass them into the Transformer decoder\\nto predict the target rationales. (2) Answer gener-\\nation stage: The second stage aims at generating\\nthe final answer and is largely similar to the first\\nstage. The main difference is that the input text\\nis concatenated with the predicted rationales from\\nthe first stage. It is worth noting that the above\\nprocess describes a general multimodal reasoning\\nframework. However, for text-only reasoning tasks,\\nthere are no image features, so the image encod-\\ning and vision feature fusion processes mentioned\\nabove can be omitted. In the following section,\\nwe will provide a detailed exposition of the two\\nkey steps of our GoT reasoning framework: GoT\\nconstruction and GoT encoding and feature fusion.\\n2.1\\nGoT Construction\\nGoT employs thought graphs to simulate human de-\\nductive reasoning, thereby modeling humans’ abil-\\nity for leaps of thought. Our aim is to reflect the\\nmost fundamental deduction process by construct-\\ning a thought graph. If we have evidence that x →\\ny and y →z, then it follows that x →z. In Fig-\\nure 3, the deduction reasoning can be formulated\\nas follows: Earthquake\\ncomes from\\n−→\\n{earth, quake},\\n{earth, quake} means\\n−→{ground, shake}. It is easy to\\nreason that Earthquake−→{ground, shake}.\\nWe\\npropose\\na\\nnovel\\nExtract-Clustering-\\nCoreference (ECC) process to construct thought\\ngraphs.\\nECC first extracts deductive triplets\\nT = {ti = (ti\\nx, ti\\ny, ti\\nz)} as the discrete raw graph,\\nwhere ti\\nx, ti\\ny, and ti\\nz are thought units of the i-th\\ntriplet, and there exists an edge ei\\nxy between ti\\nx and\\nti\\ny, and an edge ei\\nyz between ti\\ny and ti\\nz. Then, ECC\\nclusters the nodes that refer to the same mentions\\nto conduct coreference resolution. Specifically,\\nwe replace every graph node that belongs to a\\ncoreference cluster with the most representative\\nmention in the cluster. By adopting this technique,\\nour model is better equipped with denser thought\\ngraphs and the ability for deductive reasoning. The\\ndetailed algorithm is illustrated in Algorithm 1.\\nIn GoT construction, during the rationale gen-\\neration stage, the input text consists of concate-\\nnated question, context, and choices.

We apply coreference reso-\\nlution to the extracted nodes using the Stanford\\nCoreNLP system (Manning et al., 2014).\\nThe\\nconstructed thought graph is denoted as G(N, E),\\nwhere N represents the nodes extracted by OpenIE\\nand E represents the adjacency matrix.

In multimodal GoT reasoning, the image is\\nencoded using an additional vision encoder.\\n2.2.1\\nBase Encoder\\nText Encoder\\nFor text representation, we use the\\nTransformer encoder (e.g. T5 (Raffel et al., 2020a))\\nto encode the input text. Given input sentence S =\\n{w0, ..., wl}, we extract the hidden states from the\\nlast layer of the Transformer encoder to obtain the\\ntext representation HT :\\nHT = {h0, h1, ..., hl} = Encodertext(S)\\n(1)\\nwhere hi is the hidden representation of token i and\\nl represents the length of the text input.\\nVision Encoder (Optional)\\nFor multimodal rea-\\nsoning with vision modality, following (Zhang\\net al., 2023), we extract patch-level features of\\nimage I using readily available vision extraction\\nmodel as vision encoder Encodervision and then\\nemploy a trainable projection matrix WI to project\\nthe extracted features into the vision representation\\nHI which have the same shape with HT .\\nHI = WIEncodervision(I)\\n(2)\\n2.2.2\\nGoT Encoder\\nNode Embedding\\nWe first use special tokens\\n<s> and </s> to highlight every thought graph\\nnode.\\nSpecifically, for node set with j nodes\\nN = {n0, ...nj} , we construct the node input as p\\nand then feed the p into the same text encoder and\\nutilize the output representation of the special token\\n<s> as the initial node representation.

Our GoT encoder employs a multi-head\\ngraph attention layer, following (Velickovic et al.,\\n2018), we concatenate the output of each graph\\nattention layer and further pass it to a output graph\\nattention layer with the same architecture:\\nhg′\\ni = ∥K\\nk=1GELU\\n\\uf8eb\\n\\uf8edX\\nj∈Ni\\nαk\\nijWkhs\\nj\\n\\uf8f6\\n\\uf8f8\\n(9)\\nhg′′\\ni\\n= GELU\\n\\uf8eb\\n\\uf8edX\\nj∈Ni\\nαijWhg′\\nj\\n\\uf8f6\\n\\uf8f8\\n(10)\\nwhere K is the number of attention heads, || is\\nthe concatenate operation, and n is the number of\\nnodes in thought graph.

In conclusion, our results confirm the\\neffectiveness of utilizing two-dimensional graph-\\nof-thought and demonstrate the potential of incor-\\nporating GoT into reasoning for LMs.\\n4.2\\nFurther Exploration\\n4.2.1\\nAblation Study\\nAQUA-RAT\\nIn order to make sure that intro-\\nducing thought graphs into GoT reasoning indeed\\nboost the performance, we conduct the following\\nexperiments:\\n(1) Random Thought Graph\\nIn the Random Thought Graph experiment, we\\nmaintain the GoT framework while introducing ran-\\ndomness into the process. We construct a thought\\ngraph by randomly selecting nodes and arbitrarily\\nestablishing connections between them. This ap-\\nproach is designed to evaluate the extent to which\\nthe GoT reasoning mechanism is reliant on the\\nstructured organization of thought graphs.\\n(2)\\nTriplets Concatenation In the Triplets Concate-\\nnation experiment, we take a straightforward ap-\\nproach by appending the extracted triplets directly\\nto the input text. This method aims to assess the\\nimpact of omitting the structural information typi-\\ncally provided by thought graphs, offering insight\\ninto the significance of this structural element in\\nthe reasoning process. (3) Coreference Injection\\nIn the Coreference Injection experiment, we ex-\\nplore the potential benefits of integrating corefer-\\nence resolution directly into the language model’s\\nreasoning process. We achieve this by incorpo-\\nrating coreference information into the input text,\\nwhere all instances of coreferent entities are re-\\nplaced with a consistent phrase, followed by model\\nfine-tuning. This experiment seeks to understand\\nthe role of coreference resolution in enhancing the\\nmodel’s deductive capabilities.\\nTable 3 shows the overall ablation results. From\\nthe table, we can see that by randomly construct\\nthought graphs to disrupt the deductive reasoning\\nprocess, our model suffers a loss of 1.78%, indicat-\\ning the effectiveness of GoT.

This performance gap of 0.89\\nclearly demonstrates the significance of the struc-\\ntural information in our approach. For Coreference\\nInjection, the model suffers a loss of 1.77 % ac-\\ncuracy. We believe that these outcomes can be\\nattributed to a couple of factors: (1) Simply re-\\nplacing coreferent entities may lead to a loss of\\ncoherence in sentences, resulting in a reduction\\nof semantic information and consequently having\\na limited impact on overall accuracy. (2) Open\\nInformation Extraction (OpenIE) for coreference\\nresolution is not flawless, and direct replacement\\nof entities might introduce noise that misleads the\\nlanguage model during judgment.\\nContrastingly, the construction of a thought\\ngraph in the GoT framework does not compromise\\nthe original textual information (questions and ra-\\ntionales). Instead, it introduces additional structural\\nassistance for LMs to conduct reasoning effectively.\\nThus, we contend that GoT’s approach is indispens-\\nable and beneficial, as it supplements the LM’s\\ncomprehension without introducing potential noise\\nor loss of coherence in the input text.\\nScienceQA\\nTo examine the impact of different\\nbackbone and vision encoder configurations on the\\nGoT, we employed a distinct set of model settings.\\nMore specifically, we adopted the pre-trained T5\\ncheckpoint UnifiedQA (Khashabi et al., 2020) as\\nthe backbone model and utilized DETR (Carion\\net al., 2020) for the vision encoder, with results\\nillustrated in the Table 4. As shown, our GoT out-\\nperforms Mutimodal-CoT across various model\\nconfigurations. A comparison reveals that GoT\\ncan achieve greater improvements on smaller mod-\\nels. We believe the main reason is that when the\\nlanguage model is not as robust, or when employ-\\ning a relatively weaker vision encoder like DETR\\ncompared to ViT, GoT can leverage the inherent\\ninformation within the language to enhance per-\\nformance significantly. Additionally, to prove that\\nour GoT’s performance gain is not simply due to\\nan increase in parameters, we conducted an abla-\\ntion study. We expanded the parameter count of\\nMultimodal-CoTbase to match our 233M model\\nsize by adding two layers of MLP instead of one in\\nthe gated fusion module, referred to as Multimodal-\\nCoTbase(enlarged). We also constructed a random\\nthought graph ablation study on the ScienceQA\\ndataset. The results from the ablation studies can\\nbe observed in the table 4. From the table, it is\\nevident that our model significantly outperforms\\nthe enlarged Multimodal-CoT by an accuracy of\\n2.04%. These findings convincingly demonstrate\\nthe significance of incorporating thought graphs\\ninto multimodal reasoning. The performance of\\nGoT with a randomly constructed thought graph\\nwas even lower than Mutimodal-CoT, indicating\\nthat when the language model and vision encoder\\nare weaker, the model relies more heavily on GoT\\nfor reasoning.\\nModel\\nACC\\n∆\\nUnifiedQA+DETR\\nMutimodal-CoTbase\\n77.67\\n-\\nMutimodal-CoTlarge\\n81.37\\n-\\nGoTbase\\n81.21\\n3.54\\nGoTlarge\\n82.74\\n1.37\\nAblation Studies\\nMutimodal-CoTbase(enlarged)\\n79.17\\n-2.04\\nGoTbase w/ Random Thought Graph\\n76.74\\n-4.47\\nTable 4: Ablation results of GoT on ScienceQA dataset.\\nFor GoT models ∆indicates the performance gains of\\nGoT models over their Multimodal-CoT counterparts.\\nIn the ablation studies, ∆represents improvements rela-\\ntive to the GoTbase model\\n4.2.2\\nAnalysis\\nPerformance on Different Classes\\nIn order to\\ninvestigate the impact of GoT on the overall model\\nperformance across different subjects , we calcu-\\nlated the accuracy for different subjects and com-\\npared it with that of Mutimodal-CoT. We also\\ncompare the performance of two models on dif-\\nferent question classes.The radar Figure 5 shows\\nthe overall results for our base model. With re-\\nspect to various subjects and question classes, our\\nmodel demonstrates superior performance over the\\nMutimodal-CoTbase and attains a more consistent\\nand enhanced outcome. Our model presents out-\\nstanding advantages especially in the field of social\\nscience, with an accuracy improvement of 5.25%.\\nFor different question classes, our model demon-\\nstrates the largest improvement on questions involv-\\ning images. Our hypothesis is that by constructing\\na thought graph and integrating the three features of\\ntext, image, and thought graph, we can better align\\nthe textual and visual information for the model,\\nthus maximizing the utilization of visual informa-\\ntion and obtaining more accurate answers.\\nFigure 5: Performance on different question classes\\n2\\n4\\n6\\n8\\n10\\n12\\n60\\n70\\n80\\n90\\n100\\nGrades\\nAccuracy(%)\\nOursbase\\nMutimodal-CoTbase\\nFigure 6: Performance on different grades\\nPerformance on Different Grades\\nIt can be\\nseen from the Table 2 that Mutimodal-CoT expe-\\nrience a decrease in accuracy of 1.78 as the grade\\nlevel of the given question increases while GoT\\nonly has minor decrease of 0.56. We believe the\\nmain reason is that by incorporating GoT, models\\nacquires the ability for deductive reasoning and can\\nbetter comprehend the relationships between differ-\\nent entities and thus better understand the meaning\\nof the problems. Through this method, for higher-\\ngrade problems with greater complexity, the model\\ncan construct a thought graph to help itself gener-\\nate a more complete logical chain for deduction,\\nthereby generating more accurate answers. More\\ndetailed model performance on different grades can\\nbe found in Figure 6. We can see that in the lower\\ngrade, two models achieves a similar performance.\\nAs the grade level increases and the difficulty of\\nthe questions becomes more challenging, the gap\\nbetween our model and the Mutimodal-CoT model\\ngradually widens. Due to the small number of ques-\\ntions (≤130) available for each grade in grade 1\\nand grades 11-12, there is greater fluctuation in the\\naccuracy of both models. Nevertheless, it is evident\\nfrom the table that our model exhibits stronger and\\nmore stable advantages over Mutimodal-CoT in\\neach grade.\\nCase Study and Limitation\\nIn order to gain a\\ndeeper understanding of the performance of GoT,\\nwe conduct case studies which can be found in\\nthe Appendix E. We also visualize the attention\\nweights aij in GoT encoder to demonstrate how\\nGoT performs deductive reasoning to generate\\nmore accurate answers in Appendix F. For the lim-\\nitation of this work, compared to CoT, GoT may\\nresult in additional computational costs and slightly\\nslower training times. Detailed limitation analysis\\ncan be found in Appendix G.\\n5\\nConclusion\\nWe introduce a novel Graph-of-Thought (GoT) rea-\\nsoning approach, which is an innovative method\\nfor modeling the non-sequential nature of human\\nthinking for LMs. GoT enhances LMs with deduc-\\ntive reasoning abilities, providing a more realistic\\nrepresentation of thought processes. Our exper-\\niments showcases the superiority of GoT on the\\ntext-only reasoning dataset AQUA-RAT, achieving\\na similar result compared to GPT-3 model while\\nutilizing significantly fewer parameters. Further-\\nmore, GoT establishes a new state-of-the-art on\\nthe multimodal reasoning benchmark, ScienceQA\\nwith fewer parameters. This performance surpasses\\nstrong ChatGPT and GPT-4 systems, as well as hu-\\nman performance, demonstrating the efficacy of\\nGoT. Through comprehensive case studies and ab-\\nlation studies, we provide substantial evidence of\\nthe effectiveness of GoT in reasoning tasks.

CoRR, abs/2302.00923.\\nAppendix\\nA\\nRelated Works\\nIn chain-of-thought reasoning, one idea leads to the\\nnext in a logical sequence and builds on previous\\nknowledge. Each idea is supported by evidence\\nor reasoning, and the conclusions drawn from the\\nchain are logical and sound. Most CoT methods\\ncan be divided into two categories based on how to\\ngenerate the final answer: (1) prompting for CoT,\\nincluding zero-shot CoT and few-shot CoT; and (2)\\nfine-tuning for CoT.\\nZero-shot CoT Prompting\\nAs large language\\nmodels continue to advance rapidly, many re-\\nsearchers are beginning to explore CoT reasoning\\nfor LLMs. The zero-shot CoT method proposed\\nby Kojima et al. (2022) consists of two stages: (1)\\nadding a \"Let’s think step by step\" prompt to gener-\\nate CoT, and (2) concatenating the generated CoT\\nand adding the phrase \"So the answer is\" to ob-\\ntain the final answer. Tree-of-Thought (ToT) (Yao\\net al., 2023) enables deliberate decision-making\\nthrough exploration of coherent text units. ToT di-\\nvides thoughts into thought units and models them\\nas a tree-like search process. Although both GoT\\nand ToT aim to capture human non-linear thoughts,\\nGoT is distinct from ToT in terms of both methodol-\\nogy and objectives. We believe that human thinking\\ninvolves both linear and non-linear aspects. Thus,\\nwe build upon the linear CoT framework by in-\\ncorporating non-linear structures to simultaneously\\ncapture both linear and non-linear human reason-\\ning. Tree-of-thoughts focuses on modeling non-\\nlinear thoughts explicitly, whereas our approach\\nleverages non-linear structures to assist the Chain-\\nof-Thought reasoning.\\nFew-shot CoT Prompting\\nFew-shot CoT rea-\\nsoning for LLMs, however, utilizes multiple input-\\noutput pairs to prompt the LLMs to output CoT\\nand obtain the final answer. Due to its ability to\\nprovide better performance compared to Zero-shot\\nCoT, Few-shot CoT has gained more attention in\\nresearch, particularly through effective demonstra-\\ntions. Few-shot CoT prompting was first formally\\nexplored by Wei et al. (2022a) and is a form of dis-\\ncrete prompt learning that involves context learning\\nin large models. Compared to traditional in-context\\nlearning, which prompts LLMs with a list of input-\\noutput demonstration pairs along with a test input\\nto allow the model to predict output, Few-shot CoT\\nprompting outputs additional logical reasoning pro-\\ncedures apart from the target output. Wang et al.\\n(2022) proposed a follow-up method to (Wei et al.,\\n2022a). The main improvement is that the model\\nuses the majority vote for the answers, which was\\nfound to significantly improve the performance of\\nthe CoT. However, these few-shot CoT models de-\\npend on hand-crafted demonstrations. To solve this\\nproblem, Zhang et al. (2022) proposed Auto-CoT,\\nwhich maintains the diversity of sampled questions\\nand generates reasoning chains to automatically\\nconstruct demonstrations. Specifically, Auto-CoT\\nconsists of two main stages: (1) Problem clustering:\\ndivide the given dataset of problems into several\\nclusters; (2) Demonstration sampling: select a rep-\\nresentative problem from each cluster and use a\\nsimple heuristic method to generate its reasoning\\nchain. Furthermore, Lu et al. (2023) also explores\\nfew-shot CoT reasoning for recently popular LLMs\\nChatGPT and GPT-4.\\nCoT Fine-tuning\\nIn Zhang et al. (2023), it was\\nproposed to fine-tune smaller language models in-\\nstead of prompting them in LLMs. And this ap-\\nproach enabled the CoT to go beyond textual infor-\\nmation and incorporate visual (image) modalities\\nusing a gated fusion mechanism into a two-stage\\nCoT. The results demonstrated that CoT fine-tuning\\nwith fewer parameters has potential. Therefore, in\\nthis work, we focus on fine-tuning for CoT to re-\\nduce the number of required model parameters and\\nhelp LLMs better comprehend different modalities.\\nHowever, previous CoT research has been limited\\nto different modalities, such as textual and vision\\ninformation, without considering the deduction rea-\\nsoning process. Therefore, in this work, we move\\nbeyond modeling the reasoning process solely as\\na thought chain and elevate it to a thought graph.\\nWe provide a more comprehensive and nuanced\\nrepresentation, enabling LLMs to perceive the de-\\nduction reasoning process accurately, resulting in\\nmore precise answer generation.\\nB\\nDataset\\nAQUA-RAT dataset consists of about 100,000 al-\\ngebraic word problems with natural language ra-\\ntionales. For AQUA-RAT, the model is trained to\\nreasoning through the steps to generate the final\\nanswer. ScienceQA benchmark is the pioneering\\nlarge-scale dataset for multimodal science ques-\\ntions, equipped with comprehensive annotations for\\nanswers, including detailed lectures and explana-\\ntions. The dataset contains 21k questions covering\\nthree subjects: natural science, language science,\\nand social science. Each question is presented with\\na context in the form of natural language or an\\noptional image. The model is trained to elucidate\\nthe reasoning process in natural language while\\nchoosing the answer from a set of options.\\nSplits\\n#Problems\\nTrain\\n97467\\nDev\\n254\\nTest\\n254\\nTable 5: AQUA-RAT dataset statistics (# denotes num-\\nbers)\\nStatistic\\nNumber\\nSplits\\n#Train\\n12,726\\n#Dev\\n4,241\\n#Test\\n4,241\\n#Total\\n21,208\\nAttribute\\n#Subjects\\n3\\n#Topic\\n26\\n#Category\\n127\\n#Skill\\n379\\nTable 6: ScienceQA dataset statistics (# denotes num-\\nbers)\\nC\\nTraining Parameters\\nParameters\\nValue\\nEpochs\\n100\\nBatch size for T5-base (per device)\\n10\\nBatch size for T5-large (per device)\\n8\\nLearning rate\\n5e-5\\nWeight decay\\n0.01\\nMax input length\\n512\\nMax number of nodes\\n150\\nTable 7: Training parameters for GoT\\nD\\nRationale Generation Results\\nThe rationale genration results can be found in Ta-\\nble 8. We can observe from Table 8 that the im-\\npact of GoT on rationale generation is limited. We\\nattribute this limitation to the fact that the input\\ntext for thought graph construction only includes\\nquestions and choices. Consequently, the thought\\ngraph constructed from such limited information\\ncan only facilitate constrained deductive reasoning.\\nHowever, in the answer generation stage, when pro-\\nvided with rationales, the model needs to possess\\nstronger deductive reasoning capabilities to under-\\nstand the relationship between rationales, questions,\\nand choices.\\nE\\nCase Study\\nTo facilitate a more illustrative comparison between\\nGoT and the CoT, we have selected several repre-\\nsentative examples. Figure 7 illustrates the exam-\\nples from AQUA-RAT dataset. Figure 8 to Figure\\n11 illustrates examples from ScienceQA dataset.\\nFrom Figure 8 and Figure 9, we can see that GoT\\ncan better understand the rationales and generate\\nmore accurate result. In Figure 10, we can see that\\nwhen provided with wrong rationale, our model is\\nmore robust to the noise and can focus on more\\nimportant key information. (We highlight the noisy\\nwrong rationale in red and correct key rationale\\nin green). Figure 11 presents a language prob-\\nlem which have less context and requires a certain\\namount of common sense knowledge. Hence, the\\nimpact of constructing a mind map on enhancing\\nthe model is not significant. Therefore, both GoT\\nand CoT predict wrong answers.\\nF\\nRepresentation Visualization\\nIn order to demonstrate the deductive reasoning\\nprocess of GoT more intuitively, we visualized the\\nattention weights of the GoT encoder. The visu-\\nalization results can be found in Figure 12. We\\ntook Figure 10 as an example. In Figure 10, even\\ngiven a wrong rationale, GoT still manages to gen-\\nerate the right answer. We select 14 representative\\nthought nodes and found that \"blue\",\"color\", and\\n\"common\" have the greatest weights which indi-\\ncates that GoT guides the model to focus on more\\nimportant words and conduct correct deductive rea-\\nsoning. For the disruptive node \"a hard object,\" our\\nmodel can effectively discriminate against it and as-\\nsign a lower attention weight to prevent the model\\nfrom selecting incorrect answers, as traditional CoT\\nmodels often do due to erroneous rationales.\\nG\\nLimitation\\nCompared to Mutimodal-CoT (Zhang et al., 2023),\\nincorporating GoT may result in additional com-\\nputational costs and slightly slower training times.\\nMODELS\\nBLEU1\\nBLEU4\\nROUGE\\nSIMILARITY\\nAQUA-RAT\\nFLAN-Alpacabase\\n19.78\\n3.49\\n28.40\\n68.61\\nFLAN-Alpacalarge\\n22.45\\n5.40\\n29.55\\n70.34\\nGoT-T5base\\n22.05\\n5.02\\n29.18\\n69.09\\nGoT-T5large\\n24.47\\n6.68\\n29.86\\n71.58\\nScienceQA\\nMutimodal-CoT∗\\nbase (Zhang et al., 2023)\\n91.04\\n86.81\\n93.24\\n96.34\\nGoT-T5base\\n92.50\\n88.79\\n94.39\\n96.74\\nGoT-T5large\\n93.49\\n90.09\\n95.17\\n97.33\\nTable 8: Rationale generation results (%).

This work provides a novel\\nexploration of refining thought representation\\nwithin LLMs, paving the way for advancements\\nin reasoning and AI cognition.\\n1\\nIntroduction\\nRecent advancements in reasoning have demon-\\nstrated that the reasoning capabilities of large lan-\\nguage models (LLMs) can be enhanced by intro-\\nducing structure into the reasoning process (Wei\\net al., 2023; Yao et al., 2023; Besta et al., 2024). For\\ninstance, the chain-of-thought approach organizes\\ntextual reasoning in a step-by-step manner using a\\nlinear chain structure (Wei et al., 2023). Building\\non this, following works have shown that incor-\\nporating more complex organizational structures\\nfurther improves reasoning performance (Besta\\net al., 2024; Yao et al., 2023). However, these\\napproaches structure reasoning only at the level\\nof connections between distinct reasoning steps\\n(inter-thought level) and leave the content of in-\\ndividual steps (thought level) unstructured. This\\nraises the critical question: Can LLMs’ reason-\\ning abilities be further enhanced by introducing\\nstructure within individual thoughts?\\nTo address this question, we draw inspiration\\nfrom cognitive neuroscience theories of human\\nthought. Neuroscientists have found that humans\\nthink in a structured way, with the brain’s orga-\\nnization facilitating sequential and goal-oriented\\nreasoning. Christoff and Gabrieli (2000) provided\\nearly evidence that the prefrontal cortex supports\\nstructured reasoning through a rostrocaudal hi-\\nerarchy, enabling the processing of increasingly\\nabstract concepts and complex goal-directed be-\\nhavior. Later, Friston (2005)’s predictive coding\\nframework demonstrated how structured cognition\\nemerges from the brain’s ability to build hierarchi-\\ncal models, combining experiences with current in-\\nput to predict results. More recently, Jeff Hawkins\\n(Hawkins, 2021) argued that humans think in a\\nstructured manner, with the neocortex organizing\\nknowledge in certain structures, and thinking arises\\nfrom neurons activating sequential locations in\\nthese frames. Building on these insights, we pro-\\npose investigating whether similarly structured rep-\\nresentations can be incorporated into LLMs to en-\\nhance their reasoning and planning capabilities.\\nIn this work, we adopt a simple yet effective\\nstructural format—a tabular schema—to approxi-\\nmate the structured nature of human thinking pro-\\ncesses. In our approach, the schema of a table\\nserves as a framework for organizing and navigat-\\ning knowledge. Inspired by the sequential pro-\\ncesses described in neuroscience—where neurons\\nactivate specific patterns step by step (Hawkins,\\n2021)—we model these processes as the sequen-\\ntial population of rows in a table, moving across\\ncolumns according to a predefined schema. A sin-\\ngle table can encapsulate one or more such struc-\\ntured thought processes, providing a coherent con-\\narXiv:2501.02152v1  [cs.AI]  4 Jan 2025\\ntainer for organizing and connecting thinking steps\\nand associated information. Tables not only repre-\\nsent step-by-step processes for achieving specific\\ngoals but also serve as robust frameworks for plan-\\nning tasks. Moreover, utilizing tables as structured\\nrepresentations enables schema design that ensures\\norganization and data integrity, thereby facilitating\\nefficient verification and analysis.\\nThe contributions of our paper are as follows:\\n• Motivated by insights from cognitive neuro-\\nscience regarding the structured nature of hu-\\nman thinking, we propose a novel framework,\\nTable as Thought, that injects structure at the\\nthought level. To the best of our knowledge,\\nthis is the first exploration and demonstration\\nof integrating structured representations di-\\nrectly into the reasoning process of large lan-\\nguage models.\\n• We demonstrate the advantages of Table as\\nThought in tasks requiring planning and math-\\nematical reasoning, highlighting its poten-\\ntial to enhance performance on tasks that de-\\nmand sequential and goal-oriented thought\\nprocesses.\\n• We provide a detailed and comprehensive anal-\\nysis of Table as Thought, offering insights into\\nits functionality and strengths, and comparing\\nthe benefits of structured versus unstructured\\nthought representations. We believe these find-\\nings can inspire future research into the nature\\nand representation of thought processes in ar-\\ntificial intelligence and computational linguis-\\ntics.\\n2\\nRelated Work\\nStructures in LLM Reasoning\\nRecent advance-\\nments in large language models (LLMs) have in-\\ncreasingly focused on integrating structured pro-\\ncesses to enhance reasoning capabilities. Chain-of-\\nThought prompting (Wei et al., 2023) introduces a\\nstep-by-step framework that organizes thoughts in\\na sequential manner, enabling more coherent rea-\\nsoning. Building on this, Tree of Thoughts (Yao\\net al., 2023) and Graph of Thoughts (Besta et al.,\\n2024) employ hierarchical and networked struc-\\ntures to further enhance problem-solving, leverag-\\ning branching and interconnected paths. Moreover,\\nself-consistency (Wang et al., 2023) improves reli-\\nability by sampling multiple reasoning paths and\\nselecting the most consistent outcome, thereby ad-\\ndressing variability in generated responses.\\nWhile these methods excel at organizing rea-\\nsoning at a macro level—such as through chain-\\ning, branching, or aggregating thought paths—they\\ndo not address the internal structure of individual\\nthoughts. Our work is distinct in that it introduces\\nstructure directly at the thought level, refining the\\ngranularity of reasoning processes in LLMs. By\\nfocusing on the internal organization of individual\\nreasoning steps, we provide a novel perspective\\non enhancing the depth and precision of structured\\nreasoning in LLMs.\\nRepresentations of Tables in LLM Inference\\nTables have traditionally played a significant role\\nin LLMs for tasks involving the understanding\\nand processing of tabular data, such as knowledge\\nretrieval (Cong et al., 2024), question answering\\nover structured data (Yin et al., 2020; Zhang et al.,\\n2024b), and tabular reasoning (Herzig et al., 2020;\\nDeng et al., 2024). In these tasks, tables are lever-\\naged only as input for interpretation and manipula-\\ntion.\\nThe Chain-of-Table framework (Wang et al.,\\n2024) extends the application of tables by employ-\\ning them as proxies for intermediate thoughts in rea-\\nsoning tasks involving tabular data. In this frame-\\nwork, LLMs iteratively update a table, forming a\\ndynamic reasoning chain where the table evolves\\nbased on intermediate results. While this approach\\nhas proven effective on tabular-specific datasets, it\\nremains inherently tied to tasks where tabular data\\nis part of the input or reasoning context.\\nIn contrast, our work redefines the role of tables\\nby utilizing them as a universal framework for struc-\\nturing and representing the internal thought pro-\\ncesses of LLMs in non-table-specific tasks, such as\\nplanning and mathematical reasoning. Unlike prior\\napproaches that depend on pre-existing tabular in-\\nputs, we employ tables as dynamic containers to or-\\nganize and manipulate thoughts step by step. This\\napproach enables structured reasoning even in tasks\\nwhere no tabular data is initially present, bridging\\nthe gap between unstructured text-based reasoning\\nand structured problem-solving paradigms. By gen-\\neralizing the utility of tables beyond table-specific\\nreasoning tasks, our work marks a significant de-\\nparture from previous methods and demonstrates\\nthe versatility of this novel framework.\\nQuery\\nSchema Design\\nStructured \\nThoughts\\nReasoning Table\\nReasoning \\nVerification\\n{                \\nParticipant_Name: \\nMichelle,\\nUnavailable_Time:  \\n11:00 to 12:00,\\n...\\n }\\nParticipant Name\\nUnavailable Time\\n…\\nAvailable Time\\nSelected Time\\nParticipant\\nUnavailable \\n…\\nSelected \\nMichelle\\n11:00 to 12:00\\n9:30 to 10:30\\nSteven\\n9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 \\nto 12:00, ….\\n9:30 to 10:30\\nJerry\\n9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 \\nto 11:00, …\\n9:30 to 10:30\\nYou need to \\nschedule a \\nmeeting for \\nMichelle, \\nSteven and \\nJerry for \\none hour …\\n❌\\n✅\\nAnswer\\n✅: The reasoning \\nprocess is correct.\\n❌: Selected Time \\nconflicts with Jerry’s \\nunavailable time…\\nThe meeting \\nshould be \\nscheduled \\n9:30 to 10:30\\nFigure 1: The Overall Pipeline for Table as Thought Reasoning. The figure illustrates how Table as Thought\\nstructures reasoning by iteratively populating a reasoning table based on the schema, verifying consistency, and\\nupdating the table until the final answer is achieved.\\n3\\nTable as Thought\\nWe\\npresent\\nthe\\ndesign\\nof\\nthe\\nTable\\nas\\nThought framework, which introduces a novel\\napproach to reasoning in large language models by\\nleveraging tables as structured representations of\\nthoughts.\\nTable as Thought.\\nTable as Thought employs\\na table as a container to represent one or more\\nstructured thoughts. These tables, referred to as\\n\"reasoning tables\", encapsulate thoughts and pro-\\nvide a transparent representation of the reasoning\\nprocess. A reasoning table T is initialized with an\\noriginal table schema S, which is defined by the\\nLLM for a given query Q. Structured thoughts Θ\\nare then generated based on S, with each thought\\ncorresponding to a row in the reasoning table T.\\nThe table T is subsequently populated and updated\\naccording to these structured thoughts Θ.\\nThe overall reasoning workflow using the reason-\\ning table is illustrated in Figure 1 and formalized\\nin Algorithm 1.\\nAlgorithm 1 Table as Thought\\nRequire: Query Q\\nEnsure: A table T that satisfies Q\\n1: S ←DESIGNSCHEMA(Q)\\n// Define table\\nschema\\n2: Initialize an empty table T with schema S.\\n3: while not SUFFICIENT(T, Q) do\\n4:\\nΘ ←REFLECT(T, Q) // Generate possible\\nupdates\\n5:\\nT ←UPDATETABLE(T, Θ)\\n// Apply\\nupdates if needed\\n6: end while\\n7: return T\\nSchema Development Module\\nThe Schema\\nDevelopment Module dynamically adapts table\\nschemas to accommodate various queries across\\ndifferent reasoning tasks. For constraint-planning\\ntasks, where the primary objective is to satisfy\\nconstraints, we prompt LLMs to identify the con-\\nstraints explicitly before designing the schema.\\nThis ensures that both explicit and implicit con-\\nstraints are addressed in the reasoning process. For\\nmathematical reasoning tasks, the schema is tai-\\nlored to reflect the logical progression of the rea-\\nsoning steps, enabling systematic organization of\\ncritical information.\\nThe headers in the table schemas are designed\\nto represent essential reasoning steps and key infor-\\nmation pertinent to the task. These headers act as\\nanchors for organizing and verifying intermediate\\nand final reasoning outputs.\\nFor example, consider the travel planning query:\\nI plan to travel alone, and my\\nplanned budget for the trip is\\naround $1,100.\\nIn this case, a key constraint is that the total cost\\nshould not exceed $1,400. To address this con-\\nstraint, the schema must include a header such as\\nCost, with the type Number, ensuring that the rele-\\nvant information is captured and evaluated against\\nthe budgetary constraint.\\nFor a mathematical reasoning task, such as a\\nquestion from the GSM8K dataset:\\nA robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber\\nand half that much white fiber.\\nHow many bolts in total does it\\ntake?\\nHere, the reasoning process requires consideration\\nof the quantities of blue and white fibers. The\\nschema should therefore include keys such as Blue\\nFiber and White Fiber, ensuring that all relevant\\nelements are systematically tracked and calculated.\\nReasoning Verification Module\\nThe inclusion\\nof this module stems from our findings during ex-\\nperiments that current LLMs sometimes fail to gen-\\nerate the complete reasoning process with struc-\\ntured thoughts to solve a query. However, this\\nmodule is designed not only to verify the complete-\\nness of the reasoning process, but also to ensure its\\ncorrectness.\\nFor constraint reasoning tasks, the module guar-\\nantees that all necessary information required to\\nmeet the constraints defined in the schema is cap-\\ntured and satisfied. Specifically, it verifies whether\\nthe constraints identified during the schema devel-\\nopment phase are adhered to. Constraint check-\\ning is generally performed internally by the LLM\\nthrough reflective reasoning on the generated ta-\\nble, with constraints explicitly listed for verifica-\\ntion. The structured nature of thoughts in Table as\\nThought introduces an additional capability: Auto-\\nCheck Constraints, which are constraints set for\\nexternal verification, performed entirely by the sys-\\ntem to ensure that the table adheres to the defined\\nconstraints. By leveraging the structured repre-\\nsentations of Table as Thought, Auto-Check Con-\\nstraints facilitate the systematic validation of inter-\\nmediate steps and final outputs without relying on\\nthe LLM.\\nFor mathematical reasoning tasks, the module\\nevaluates the correctness of the reasoning process\\nby ensuring that the table reflects an accurate and\\nlogical reasoning path toward solving the problem.\\nThis involves checking whether the intermediate\\nand final outputs align with the expected reasoning\\nsteps outlined in the schema.\\nTable Construction Module\\nThe Table Con-\\nstruction Module iteratively generates structured\\nthoughts and constructs the reasoning table by in-\\ncorporating the schema and feedback from the rea-\\nsoning verification module. This process involves\\ndynamically adding new thoughts to the table, mod-\\nifying existing entries, or removing entries that do\\nnot align with the schema or query requirements.\\nThe iterative process terminates under one of the\\nfollowing conditions:\\n1. The reasoning table is verified as complete and\\ncorrect by the reasoning verification module.\\n2. The maximum number of iterations, which is\\n10 in all our experiments, is reached.\\n4\\nExperiments\\n4.1\\nTasks and Language Models\\nFor all tasks, we adopt the original evaluation meth-\\nods to ensure consistency and comparability.\\nConstraint Planning Tasks.\\nThe goal of con-\\nstraint planning tasks is to generate plans that sat-\\nisfy both explicit and implicit constraints. We eval-\\nuate our approach on two datasets, each presenting\\ndifferent levels of complexity in the expected plans.\\nThe TravelPlanner dataset (Xie et al., 2024) re-\\nquires LLMs to generate detailed travel plans that\\nadhere to explicit constraints provided in the query,\\nsuch as budget limitations, as well as implicit con-\\nstraints derived from common sense. The expected\\ntravel plans are highly complex, encompassing\\nmulti-day agendas that include transportation, ac-\\ncommodations, and daily attractions. Due to the\\nexceptionally long context required for this task,\\nwhich results in substantial token costs, we con-\\nduct experiments exclusively with GPT-4-o-mini.\\nThe calendar scheduling task from the NaturalPlan\\nbenchmark (Zheng et al., 2024) focuses on gener-\\nating single-object plans. In this task, LLMs must\\ndetermine an appropriate meeting time based on\\nexplicit constraints, such as the company’s work-\\ning hours and the unavailable time slots of each\\nparticipant.\\nMath reasoning tasks.\\nWe evaluate LLMs using\\nGSM-8K and MATH500 to assess structured math-\\nematical reasoning. GSM-8K (Cobbe et al., 2021)\\ncontains 8,000 grade-school-level word problems,\\ntesting multi-step reasoning and numerical preci-\\nsion. MATH500 (Lightman et al., 2023) features\\n500 advanced problems from the MATH dataset\\n(Hendrycks et al., 2021), covering algebra, calcu-\\nlus, and geometry. It challenges models with tasks\\nrequiring symbolic manipulation and deep math-\\nematical understanding. These datasets help eval-\\nuate our approach across diverse scenarios, from\\nsimple arithmetic to complex problems.\\nLanguage Models.\\nThe schema design and table\\nconstruction modules in Table as Thought require\\nLLMs capable of generating complex, structured\\noutputs that conform to intricate schemas. This\\ncapability is natively supported by OpenAI’s Struc-\\ntured Outputs Mode, which allows for precise align-\\nment with defined schema requirements. Conse-\\nquently, our experiments are conducted exclusively\\non OpenAI’s GPT-4-o-mini and GPT-4-o-2024-08-\\n06 models (OpenAI et al., 2024). Expanding the\\nevaluation to include open-source models with sim-\\nilar capabilities remains an area for future work.\\n4.2\\nText Thought Baselines\\nDirect Prompting.\\nDirect Prompting involves\\nsolving queries by directly generating an answer\\nfrom the input, without prompting for any interme-\\ndiate reasoning steps.\\nCoT\\nPrompting.\\nChain-of-Thought\\n(CoT)\\nPrompting organizes reasoning as a sequential\\nchain of thoughts, thereby injecting structure into\\nthe reasoning process.\\nText as Thought.\\nThis approach differs from Ta-\\nble as Thought only in its use of unstructured repre-\\nsentations for thoughts. Text as Thought employs\\ntext as the medium for reasoning. This method\\nextends CoT prompting by iteratively updating the\\nreasoning process based on reflection. Each iter-\\nation involves generating intermediate reasoning\\nsteps, reflecting on their correctness, and refining\\nthe reasoning path as needed. The streamlined pro-\\ncess is formalized in Algorithm 2.\\nAlgorithm 2 Text as Thought\\nRequire: Query Q\\nEnsure: A text T that satisfies Q\\n1: Initialize an empty text T.\\n2: while not SUFFICIENT(T, Q) do\\n3:\\nΘ ←REFLECT(T, Q) // Generate possible\\nupdates\\n4:\\nT ←UPDATETEXT(T, Θ)\\n// Apply\\nupdates if needed\\n5: end while\\n6: return T\\n4.3\\nVariations of Table as Thought\\nTo fully explore and understand the boundaries of\\nTable as Thought, we introduce two variations to\\nthe TravelPlanner task. These variations include\\nTable as Thought with auto check constraint, which\\nadds complexity to schema design, and Table as\\nThought with given schema, which simplifies the\\ntask by providing a predefined schema.\\nTable as Thought with Auto-Check Constraint.\\nThis variation builds on the vanilla Table as\\nThought by requiring the LLM to add additional\\nconstraints during schema design to ensure data\\nintegrity and reflect the constraints present in the\\nquery. For instance, if a TravelPlanner query in-\\ncludes budget constraints, the LLM is expected to\\ndesign a schema with headers like Cost and en-\\nforce a rule ensuring that the sum of the column\\ndoes not exceed the specified budget. By introduc-\\ning this variation, we aim to explore the boundaries\\nof LLMs in designing complex reasoning structures\\nand handling intricate schema requirements.\\nTable as Thought with Given Schema.\\nIn this\\nvariation, the LLM is provided with a predefined\\nschema, as shown in Table 7, rather than designing\\nthe schema independently. The given schema is\\nderived from the evaluation pipeline of the Trav-\\nelPlanner task (Xie et al., 2024), where answers are\\nprocessed into tables following this schema before\\nevaluation. This variation serves as a comparative\\nbaseline to assess the effectiveness and adaptability\\nof schemas designed by LLMs compared to fixed,\\npredefined schemas.\\n5\\nResults\\n5.1\\nCalendar Scheduling Task\\nTable as Thought achieves the highest performance\\namong all prompting methods on the Calendar\\nScheduling Task, as shown in Table 2. On GPT-4o,\\nTable as Thought improves performance by 10.8%\\nover Direct Prompting and achieves a 5.4% im-\\nprovement compared to the Text as Thought base-\\nline. This highlights the advantage of using tables\\nas structured representations for planning over un-\\nstructured text-based representations. A similar\\ntrend is observed with GPT-4o-mini, where Table\\nas Thought outperforms other methods, suggesting\\nthe robustness of table-based reasoning for simpler\\nconstraint reasoning tasks like calendar scheduling.\\nFor GPT-4o, the improvement from Direct\\nPrompting to CoT Prompting is minimal (0.5%),\\nindicating that chain-like reasoning structures may\\nalready be embedded in the model’s reasoning\\nprocess. However, incorporating self-verification\\nthrough Text as Thought yields a 4.9% improve-\\nment. Importantly, transitioning from unstructured\\nthoughts to structured tables results in a more sub-\\nstantial performance boost (5.4%), underscoring\\nthe benefits of structured representations in reason-\\ning tasks.\\nMetric\\nDirect\\nCoT\\nText as Thought\\nTable as Thought\\nVanilla\\nw/ Auto-Check constraint\\nw/ Given Schema\\nDelivery Rate (%)\\n100.0\\n100.0\\n100.0\\n100.0\\n99.4\\n100.0\\nCommonsense Constraint Micro Pass Rate (%)\\n68.3\\n69.0\\n68.3\\n64.4\\n63.8\\n70.1\\nCommonsense Constraint Macro Pass Rate (%)\\n2.22\\n2.22\\n0.556\\n0.0\\n0.0\\n3.33\\nHard Constraint Micro Pass Rate (%)\\n7.62\\n6.19\\n3.81\\n3.33\\n1.90\\n5.95\\nHard Constraint Macro Pass Rate (%)\\n4.44\\n4.44\\n2.78\\n1.67\\n0.556\\n5.00\\nFinal Pass Rate (%)\\n0.556\\n0.556\\n0.0\\n0.0\\n0.0\\n1.11\\nTable 1: Evaluation results for different models and prompt methods on TraverPlanner Tasks on GPT4o-mini\\nDirect\\nCoT\\nText as Thought\\nTable as Thought\\nGPT-4o\\n64.0\\n64.5\\n69.4\\n74.8\\nGPT-4o-mini\\n36.2\\n38.4\\n38.4\\n42.3\\nTable 2: Performance of GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini\\nmodels under different prompting methods for calendar\\nscheduling.\\nDirect\\nCoT\\nText as Thought\\nTable as Thought\\nMATH500\\nGPT-4o\\n75.0\\n72.2\\n72.6\\n64.2\\nGPT-4o-mini\\n65.4\\n65.2\\n63.4\\n47.8\\nGSM8K\\nGPT-4o\\n95.4\\n95.9\\n95.7\\n94.1\\nGPT-4o-mini\\n93.9\\n93.6\\n92.9\\n92.4\\nTable 3: Performance of GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini mod-\\nels under different prompting methods for MATH500\\nand GSM8K.\\nDirect\\nCoT\\nText as Thought\\nMATH500\\nGPT-4o\\n4.4/25.0\\n5.4/27.8\\n4.4/27.4\\nGPT-4o-mini\\n2.0/36.6\\n2.4/34.6\\n2.8/34.8\\nGSM8K\\nGPT-4o\\n1.59/4.62\\n1.29/4.09\\n1.60/4.33\\nGPT-4o-mini\\n1.59/6.14\\n2.12/6.37\\n2.50/7.13\\nTable 4: The Percentage of Questions that Table as\\nThought successfully work out while other prompting\\nmethods failed vs failed rate of other prompting methods\\nFor GPT-4o-mini, a less advanced model, CoT\\nPrompting achieves a moderate 2.2% improvement\\nover Direct Prompting, but Text as Thought fails\\nto provide any additional gains. This suggests that\\nGPT-4o-mini lacks both the natural incorporation\\nof chain-like structures in its reasoning and the self-\\nverification capability to improve performance on\\ntext-based reasoning tasks. In contrast, Table as\\nThought demonstrates a significant 4.4% improve-\\nment over CoT Prompting, reinforcing the effec-\\ntiveness of introducing structure at the thought level\\nover chain-like structures at the reasoning level for\\nless advanced models.\\n5.2\\nTravelPlanner Task\\nTable 1 shows that Table as Thought with a given\\nschema achieves the best performance across most\\nmetrics in the TravelPlanner task, underscoring the\\npotential of structured thoughts. The significant\\nimprovement from vanilla Table as Thought to Ta-\\nble as Thought with a given schema highlights that\\ncurrent LLMs struggle to design effective table\\nschemas for achieving complex objectives. This\\nlimitation will be analyzed in more detail in the\\nnext section.\\nThe results reveal an important trend: on a chal-\\nlenging task like TravelPlanner, which demands\\nreasoning toward a complex objective, introduc-\\ning increasingly sophisticated structures into the\\nreasoning process can lead to performance degra-\\ndation. Specifically, methods that incorporate addi-\\ntional complexity—such as chain-of-thought (CoT)\\nprompting, self-reflection in Text as Thought, and\\nrule-constrained structured thoughts in Table as\\nThought with Auto-Check constraint—tend to per-\\nform worse compared to simpler approaches. The\\nexception is Table as Thought with a given schema,\\nwhich avoids this degradation by relieving the LLM\\nof the need to design its own schema, allowing it\\nto focus solely on reasoning within a predefined\\nstructure.\\n5.3\\nMath Reasoning Tasks\\nTable 3 highlights a general trend in the MATH500\\nand GSM8K tasks: introducing additional complex-\\nity into the reasoning process often leads to a per-\\nformance drop, particularly for less capable models\\nlike GPT-4o-mini. For instance, on MATH500, the\\nperformance of both GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini de-\\ncreases as the reasoning structures become more\\nsophisticated, from Direct Prompting to Text as\\nThought to Table as Thought. This effect is es-\\npecially pronounced for GPT-4o-mini, where the\\nperformance of Table as Thought falls to 47.8%,\\ncompared to 65.4% with Direct Prompting. A sim-\\nilar trend is observed on GSM8K, where the addi-\\ntion of more structured reasoning methods results\\nin marginal performance degradation. These re-\\nsults suggest that LLMs may already be overfitted\\nto math reasoning tasks, as noted in recent studies\\n(Mirzadeh et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024a).\\nDespite this general trend, Table as Thought\\ndemonstrates its potential to improve performance\\nby successfully solving questions that text-thought-\\nbased methods fail to address, particularly with\\nmore capable models like GPT-4o. Table 4 pro-\\nvides a detailed breakdown of the percentage of\\nquestions that Table as Thought solves, which were\\nmissed by other methods. On MATH500, Table\\nas Thought resolves approximately 20% of such\\nquestions, while on GSM8K, this figure exceeds\\n30%. These findings underscore the utility of struc-\\ntured reasoning in identifying alternative pathways\\nto solutions that text-based reasoning methods may\\noverlook.\\n6\\nAnalysis\\n6.1\\nEffect of Schema Design on Reasoning\\nStructures\\nSchema design plays a pivotal role in structuring\\nthe reasoning paths of Calendar Scheduling tasks.\\nDifferent schemas determine the granularity of the\\nreasoning process, which in turn affects model per-\\nformance.\\nTable 5 shows that in the one-row schema, the\\nreasoning process is concise: the LLM identifies all\\navailable time slots for participants in a single step\\nand selects a suitable meeting time. This schema\\nproduces a single-row table, encapsulating the rea-\\nsoning process in a compact form. In contrast, the\\nmulti-row schema divides the process into finer-\\ngrained steps. The LLM first extracts unavailable\\nand preferred time slots for each participant. It then\\ncomputes available time slots before aggregating\\nthis information to finalize the meeting time. This\\napproach results in a table with multiple rows, each\\nrepresenting an intermediate reasoning step, and\\nprovides a more detailed reasoning path.\\nTable 6 shows that schema complexity impacts\\nperformance differently for advanced and less capa-\\nble models. For GPT-4o, the multi-row schema out-\\nperforms the one-row schema, achieving 80.28%\\naccuracy compared to 72.93%.\\nThis suggests\\nthat the finer-grained reasoning path introduced by\\nthe multi-row schema aligns well with GPT-4o’s\\nstronger table reasoning capabilities. By explic-\\nitly structuring intermediate steps, the multi-row\\nschema allows GPT-4o to better manage constraints\\nand ensure reasoning correctness. On the contrary,\\nGPT-4o-mini performs better with the simpler one-\\nrow schema (45.05% vs. 43.46% for the multi-row\\nschema). This indicates that the increased complex-\\nity of the multi-row schema exceeds the model’s\\ntable reasoning and verification abilities, leading to\\nperformance degradation.\\nSchema Example\\nOne Row\\nTime Slot, Jesse Availability\\nKathryn Availability, Megan Availability\\nAll Participants Available, Earliest Availability\\nMulti Row\\nParticipant Name, Availability Start Time\\nAvailability End Time, Meeting Duration\\nWork Hours Constraint, Schedule Constraint\\nPreference Constraint, Proposed Meeting Time\\nTable 5: Schema examples for Multi Row Thought and\\nOne Row Thought\\nGPT-4o-mini\\nGPT-4o\\nOne Row\\n45.05\\n72.93\\nMulti Row\\n43.46\\n80.28\\nTable 6: Performance Comparison of Multi Row and\\nOne Row Schemas for GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o on\\nCalendar Scheduling\\n6.2\\nLLM Struggles to Design Effective\\nSchema for Complex Planning\\nUnlike Calendar Scheduling, which focuses on se-\\nlecting a single time slot, TravelPlanner involves\\ngenerating a comprehensive travel itinerary, sig-\\nnificantly increasing the complexity of the plan-\\nning task. Our findings indicate that tasking the\\nLLM with designing a table schema results in a\\nnotable performance drop compared to using di-\\nrect prompting with a pre-defined schema. This\\nsuggests that LLMs currently lack the capability to\\nindependently design effective table schemas for\\ncomplex planning tasks.\\nAlthough the provided schema is not per-\\nfect—omitting some critical columns, such as\\n\"cost\" for budget constraints—it is generally more\\neffective than most LLM-designed schemas. For\\ninstance, as shown in Table 7, the LLM-developed\\nschema and the given schema are structurally simi-\\nlar. However, a key difference is the use of \"Dining\\nOptions\" in the LLM-designed schema, as opposed\\nto separating dining into specific categories like\\n\"breakfast,\" \"lunch,\" and \"dinner.\" In practice, this\\nsimplification often leads the LLM to allocate only\\na single meal per day, which contradicts common-\\nsense expectations for travel planning.\\nSchema Example\\nGiven Schema\\ndays, current_city, attraction,\\ntransportation, breakfast,\\nlunch, dinner, accommodation\\nLLM Developed Schema\\nDay, Date, Location,\\nTransportation Details,\\nAccommodation Details,\\nActivities/Attractions, Dining Options,\\nEstimated Cost, Notes/Preferences\\nTable 7: Given Schema and Example of GPT-4o devel-\\noped Schema\\n6.3\\nAblation Study\\nSchema Designing\\nResoning Verification\\nACC(%)\\n✓\\n✓\\n42.3\\n✓\\n×\\n38.5 (↓3.8)\\n×\\n✓\\n36.2 (↓6.1)\\n×\\n×\\n32.7 (↓9.6)\\nTable 8: Ablation study results for GPT-4o-mini with\\nschema designing and reasoning verification effects on\\nperformance of calendar scheduling.\\nWe conducted an ablation study using GPT-4o-\\nmini on the Calendar Scheduling task to evaluate\\nthe individual contributions of schema design and\\nreasoning verification . Table 8 shows that when\\nreasoning verification is removed, accuracy drops\\nfrom 42.3% to 38.5% (↓3.8%). This indicates that\\nwithout explicitly verifying constraints, the LLM\\nmay overlook key restrictions in the query, leading\\nto false positives during self-checking. The absence\\nof schema design leads to a larger performance\\ndrop, from 42.3% to 36.2% (↓6.1%), and further\\nto 32.7% (↓9.6%) when both schema design and\\nreasoning verification are removed. This highlights\\nthe critical role of schema design in structuring\\nthe reasoning process. Table 9 shows that with-\\nout a schema, the LLM tends to create tables with\\nfewer columns, omitting key information neces-\\nsary for constraint checking. While the table with-\\nout schema design contains basic headers such as\\nParticipant and Selected Meeting Time, the\\nschema-designed table includes additional headers\\nlike Conflict Check, Work Hours Start/End,\\nand Notes/Comments. These additional columns\\ncapture critical reasoning steps and constraints, en-\\nabling more effective verification and selection of\\na valid meeting time.\\nColumn Headers\\nwo/ Schema Design\\nParticipant, Available Time Slots,\\nSelected Meeting Time\\nw/ Schema Design\\nParticipant Name, Participant Availability,\\nMeeting Duration, Meeting Day,\\nProposed Meeting Time, Work Hours Start,\\nWork Hours End, Conflict Check,\\nFinal Meeting Time , Notes/Comments\\nTable 9: Example of Column Headers of Table Thoughts\\nw/wo Schema Design\\n7\\nConclusion\\nWe proposed Table as Thought, a novel framework\\nthat introduces structured reasoning at the thought\\nlevel. The framework centers on the design and uti-\\nlization of table schemas, where the LLM is tasked\\nwith constructing a schema and generating struc-\\ntured thoughts based on it. Our results demonstrate\\nthat Table as Thought excels in constraint planning\\ntasks, showcasing its ability to manage complex\\nconstraints effectively. Moreover, the framework\\nexhibits significant potential for further improv-\\ning performance in math reasoning tasks, partic-\\nularly in addressing unsolved problems through\\nstructured reasoning.\\nAdditionally, we conducted detailed analyses of\\nthe results, exploring the interplay between schema\\ndesign, reasoning complexity, and model capabil-\\nities. These insights pave the way for future re-\\nsearch into the nature and representation of thought\\nprocesses, offering a promising direction for the\\ndevelopment of more robust reasoning frameworks\\nin LLMs.\\nLimitations\\nOur proposed methods are currently supported only\\nby models capable of generating structured data\\nwith complex schemas. This limitation restricts our\\nexperiments to a small set of closed-source models,\\nsuch as those provided by OpenAI. Consequently,\\nthe generalizability of our findings to open-source\\nLLMs remains unexplored. Future work should in-\\nvestigate approaches for adapting Table as Thought\\nto a broader range of models, including those with\\nlimited native support for structured data genera-\\ntion.\\nEthical Statement\\nThis research was conducted using publicly avail-\\nable datasets (e.g., GSM-8K, MATH500, Trav-\\nelPlanner) in compliance with their terms of use,\\nensuring no personally identifiable information\\n(PII) was processed. While our proposed frame-\\nwork, Table as Thought, aims to enhance structured\\nreasoning in LLMs, we acknowledge the potential\\nrisks of misuse in harmful applications, such as\\ndeceptive planning or adversarial reasoning. To\\nmitigate this, we advocate for responsible deploy-\\nment with appropriate safeguards.\\nReferences\\nMaciej Besta, Nils Blach, Ales Kubicek, Robert Ger-\\nstenberger, Lukas Gianinazzi, Joanna Gajda, Tomasz\\nLehmann, Michał Podstawski, Hubert Niewiadomski,\\nPiotr Nyczyk, and Torsten Hoefler. 2024.

De-\\nspite advancements in open-source models such as\\nLLaMA 3.1-8B and LLaMA 3.1-70B, these mod-\\nels encounter significant challenges in adhering to\\nthe tool schema required for the schema design and\\ntable construction modules. Specifically, they fail\\nto generate the expected outputs due to the com-\\nplexity of the tool schema, leading to errors in the\\nintermediate pipeline.\\nIn a set of 100 test examples, we observe that\\nTable as Thought fails 100% and 63% of the time\\nwhen using LLaMA 3.1-8B and LLaMA 3.1-70B,\\nrespectively. These high failure rates make experi-\\nments with open-source models infeasible because:\\n1. High Computational Cost: The need for re-\\npeated retries significantly increases computa-\\ntional overhead.\\n2.

Original Bill: Stephen’s original grocery bill was $40.00.\\n2. Vendor Fee: The vendor adds a 25% fee to the original bill. To calculate this fee:\\nVendor Fee = 0.25 × 40.00 = 10.00\\n3. Delivery Fee: The delivery fee is a flat $3.00.\\n4. Tip: Stephen added a $4.00 tip.\\nNow, we add all these amounts together to find the final price:\\nFinal Price = Original Bill + Vendor Fee + Delivery Fee + Tip\\nFinal Price = 40.00 + 10.00 + 3.00 + 4.00 = 57.00\\nTherefore, the final price of Stephen’s groceries, after all the extra fees, is $57.00.\\nD.2\\nExample where Table as Thought succeceds while Direct Prompting Fails\\nQuery: Jamal’s phone can hold 6 times more photographs than can Brittany’s phone.

We know from the problem that\\nJ = 1800. Substituting this into the equation gives:\\n1800 = 6B\\nTo find B, divide both sides by 6:\\nB = 1800\\n6\\n= 300\\nNext, the problem states that Brittany’s phone can hold 50 more photographs than the number of\\nducks in Jamal’s photograph. This gives us the equation:\\nB = D + 50\\nWe already found that B = 300. Substituting this into the equation gives:\\n300 = D + 50\\nTo find D, subtract 50 from both sides:\\nD = 300 −50 = 250\\nThus, the number of ducks in Jamal’s photograph is 250 .\\n')]"

       " 'Summary': 'Despite the success of chain of thought in enhancing language model\\nreasoning, the underlying process remains less well understood. Although\\nlogically sound reasoning appears inherently crucial for chain of thought,\\nprior studies surprisingly reveal minimal impact when using invalid\\ndemonstrations instead. Furthermore, the conventional chain of thought does not\\ninform language models on what mistakes to avoid, which potentially leads to\\nmore errors. Hence, inspired by how humans can learn from both positive and\\nnegative examples, we propose contrastive chain of thought to enhance language\\nmodel reasoning. Compared to the conventional chain of thought, our approach\\nprovides both valid and invalid reasoning demonstrations, to guide the model to\\nreason step-by-step while reducing reasoning mistakes. To improve\\ngeneralization, we introduce an automatic method to construct contrastive\\ndemonstrations. Our experiments on reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that\\ncontrastive chain of thought can serve as a general enhancement of\\nchain-of-thought prompting.',\n",

We believe that\\nour study provides valuable insights into ChatGPT’s reliabil-\\nity and underscores the need for strengthening the reliability\\nand security of large language models (LLMs).\\n1\\nIntroduction\\nChatGPT, as a large language model (LLM), has revolu-\\ntionized the way users acquire information. Unlike conven-\\ntional search engines, ChatGPT retrieves knowledge from\\nthe model itself and generates answers for users. ChatGPT’s\\nquestion-answering (QA) process typically flows smoothly\\nlike a natural chat, enhancing the user experience and en-\\ncouraging the general public to migrate to it. By January\\n2023, ChatGPT has crossed the 100-million-user milestone,\\nmaking it the fastest-growing platform in history [1].\\nGiven the enormous usage, i.e., 1 billion queries per\\nday [1], ChatGPT has raised concerns about its question-\\nanswering reliability in generic knowledge domains, e.g.,\\nscience, technology, law, medicine, etc. These concerns are\\nfurther compounded by the fact that ChatGPT’s proficiency\\nin articulating rich answers may foster trust among ordinary\\nusers who often lack the expertise or are negligent to iden-\\ntify mistakes in the model’s responses [59]. For instance, in\\nMay 2023, a lawyer used ChatGPT to retrieve legal cases for\\na brief against the Colombian airline Avianca. However, it\\nwas subsequently revealed that these cases did not exist, re-\\nsulting in sanctions on the lawyer [72]. Similarly, in April\\n2023, when asked to generate a list of legal scholars involved\\nin sexual harassment incidents, ChatGPT fabricated a sexual\\nharassment scandal involving a real professor [68]. These\\ninstances of ChatGPT’s unreliability extend beyond individ-\\nual incidents, as they can have far-reaching consequences for\\nlegal proceedings, reputation damage, and the spread of mis-\\ninformation.\\nThere exists some preliminary research evaluating the effi-\\ncacy of ChatGPT on question-answering [12,76]. However,\\nthey either use only limited samples or concentrate on ques-\\ntions of certain types or from certain QA datasets. While\\nthese evaluations provide valuable insights into ChatGPT’s\\ncapabilities, they may not fully reflect the diversity and com-\\nplexity of questions that ChatGPT could face.\\nMoreover,\\nChatGPT allows users to steer its behaviors by describing\\ndirections via system role [3], such as “you are a helpful\\nassistant.” While multiple system roles have been widely\\ndiscussed in the user community [2, 10, 61] and integrated\\ninto various applications [5, 6, 9], a systematic investigation\\ninto the impact of these system roles on ChatGPT’s reliabil-\\nity is still lacking. In addition, due to ChatGPT’s popularity,\\nit is inevitable that malicious users will, if not already, at-\\ntack ChatGPT with adversarial examples. It remains unclear\\nwhether such attacks are indeed feasible.\\nResearch Questions. To address the above issues, in this\\npaper, we measure ChatGPT’s reliability in generic question-\\nanswering (QA) scenarios from following three perspectives.\\n1. RQ1: Is ChatGPT reliable in generic QA scenarios?\\n2. RQ2: Do system roles impact ChatGPT’s reliability?\\n3. RQ3: Can ChatGPT respond reliably when facing ad-\\nversarial examples?\\nEvaluation Framework. To quantitatively evaluate Chat-\\nGPT’s reliability in the generic question-answering use\\ncases, we build an evaluation framework consisting of\\ntwo main steps: 1) establishing a representative evaluation\\ndataset and 2) assessing answers from ChatGPT (see Sec-\\ntion 3). Concretely, we collect ten QA datasets across four\\n1\\narXiv:2304.08979v2  [cs.CR]  5 Oct 2023\\nanswer types, i.e., yes/no (YN), multiple-choice (MC), ex-\\ntractive (EX), and abstractive (AB). We leverage thematic\\nanalysis to align them to a unified dataset, resulting in 5,695\\nquestions across eight question domains, including history,\\nlaw, general works, medicine, social science, science, tech-\\nnology, and recreation.\\nWe evaluate ChatGPT’s reliabil-\\nity through two perspectives: correctness and unanswerable\\nquestion identification. Our rationale is that, when answer-\\ning questions, ChatGPT should not only provide correct an-\\nswers (correctness) but can identify situations where no an-\\nswer should be provided (unanswerable question detection)\\nas well. The latter capability is especially critical in sensi-\\ntive domains such as law and medicine, as the inquirer often\\nlacks the expertise to discern errors among answers [59]. We\\nalso conduct qualitative analysis to understand why ChatGPT\\nfails to answer some questions or refuses to answer them.\\nIs ChatGPT Reliable in Generic Question-Answering\\nScenarios. We observe ChatGPT exhibits varying levels of\\nreliability in different domains. While ChatGPT shows rela-\\ntively high correctness in the recreation and technology ques-\\ntions, it underperforms in law and science domains. For ex-\\nample, the correctness of law questions on EX and AB tasks\\nis respectively 11.97% and 4.29% lower than the overall av-\\nerage correctness. ChatGPT’s ability to identify unanswer-\\nable questions is also limited. On GPT-3.5, it achieves a\\nrate of only 26.63%, and on GPT-4, the rate is even lower\\n(14.29%).\\nThese findings indicate that, when faced with\\nunanswerable questions, ChatGPT is prone to make mean-\\ningless guesses instead of rejecting the questions outright.\\nThrough qualitative analysis, we identify four failure rea-\\nsons and four refusal reasons used by ChatGPT. Interestingly,\\nChatGPT tends to use the reason “not mentioned” to reject\\nto answer. We have confirmed similar behavior of ChatGPT\\non both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models, suggesting that relying\\nsolely on model iteration is insufficient to solve reliability\\nissues.\\nDo System Roles Impact ChatGPT’s Reliability. We find\\nthat system roles may directly affect ChatGPT’s reliability.\\nFor instance, benign roles (Assistant, Expert, Expert-CoT,\\nand Expert-R) improve ChatGPT’s correctness on four QA\\ntasks, while bad and jailbreak roles generally reduce Chat-\\nGPT’s correctness and force it to select meaningless answers\\nto unanswerable questions. However, their impact is not al-\\nways evident from the role description alone. For instance,\\na jailbreak role may aim to circumvent restrictions but ulti-\\nmately result in decreased reliability. Our finding, for the first\\ntime, reveals how system roles can impact ChatGPT’s relia-\\nbility in an imperceptible way. We, therefore, emphasize the\\nimportance of evaluating a system role before applying it to\\nChatGPT.\\nCan ChatGPT Respond Reliably When Facing Adversar-\\nial Examples. Given the growing popularity of ChatGPT,\\nit is inevitable that malicious users will, if not already, at-\\ntack ChatGPT by carefully crafting adversarial examples as\\nits input.\\nIt is essential for ChatGPT to respond reliably\\nto these adversarial examples. Therefore, we also measure\\nChatGPT’s reliability against adversarial examples. We im-\\nplement five decision-based adversarial attacks with three\\nlevels of perturbations. We discover that ChatGPT is highly\\nvulnerable to sentence-level and character-level adversarial\\nattacks.\\nWe further manually engineer a prompt, namely\\nleakage prompt, to induce ChatGPT to disclose the confi-\\ndence scores. This enables us to implement score-based at-\\ntacks against ChatGPT and brings an average attack success\\nrate improvement of 0.38. Our qualitative analysis of the\\nadversarial examples identifies certain interesting cases like\\nchanging only one character is sufficient enough to alter the\\noutput of ChatGPT. These results demonstrate the vulnerabil-\\nity of ChatGPT to adversarial examples, highlighting the po-\\ntential safety/security risks associated with ChatGPT in prac-\\ntical applications.\\nOur Contributions. The contributions of the paper are as\\nsummarized as follows:\\n• We perform the first large-scale measurement of Chat-\\nGPT’s reliability in the generic QA scenario with a care-\\nfully curated set of 5,695 questions across ten datasets\\nand eight domains. Our results suggest ChatGPT’s reli-\\nability varies among different domains. We also reveal\\nthe deficiency of ChatGPT in identifying unanswerable\\nquestions, which suggests that ChatGPT tends to make\\nmeaningless guesses rather than reject answers when\\nserving unanswerable questions.\\n• We then, for the first time, systematically investigate the\\nimpacts of system roles on ChatGPT’s reliability. Sur-\\nprisingly, we find system roles can impact ChatGPT’s\\nreliability in an imperceptible way. This emphasizes the\\nimportance of evaluating a system role before applying\\nit to ChatGPT.\\n• We also assess ChatGPT’s reliability against adversarial\\nattacks. Our results show that ChatGPT is vulnerable to\\nsentence-level and character-level adversarial examples,\\nhighlighting the potential security risks associated with\\nChatGPT.\\n2\\nBackground\\n2.1\\nChatGPT\\nChatGPT is an advanced large language model (LLM) that\\nwas launched by OpenAI in November 2022. Based on the\\nenormous amount of knowledge it has learned during train-\\ning, ChatGPT can generate human-like responses to a wide\\nrange of prompts and questions [65]. Currently, the most\\nwidely used version of ChatGPT is based on the GPT-3.5\\narchitecture [23]. Access to ChatGPT on the GPT-4 model\\nis still limited and requires specific approval from OpenAI.\\nMoreover, ChatGPT allows users to define their task style by\\ndescribing those directions via roles, which are termed sys-\\ntem role by OpenAI. For example, users can write a prompt\\nstarting with “You are a helpful assistant”1 to direct Chat-\\nGPT to behave as an assistant.\\nUsers can also craft cer-\\ntain jailbreak messages, such as “You are going to pretend\\nto be DAN which stands for doing anything now” to get\\n1This is the officially recommended system role for ChatGPT.\\n2\\nTable 1: Four common QA tasks.\\nYes/NO QA (YN)\\nContext\\nA Long Island Iced Tea is a type of ...\\nQuestion\\nDo long island iced teas have tea in them?\\nAnswer\\nFALSE\\nMultiple-choice QA (MC)\\nContext\\nYou change the channels for the fourth time ...\\nQuestion\\nWhat is the most important for runners in a race?\\nOptions\\n(A) Having fun.

While Chat-\\nGPT instructed within the system roles has been increas-\\ningly used [2, 10, 61] and integrated into various applica-\\ntions [5,6,9], a systematic investigation of the effect of these\\nsystem roles is still lacking.\\n2.2\\nQuestion-Answering Task\\nQuestion-Answering (QA) is one of the main tasks in\\nNLP [26, 70].\\nGiven questions (and the context if any),\\nQA tasks evaluate a model’s capability in reading compre-\\nhension [24, 59, 60], information retrieval [36], logical rea-\\nsoning [74], and knowledge base [73].\\nBased on the an-\\nswer types, QA tasks can be generally categorized into four\\ntypes [41], i.e., yes/no [24], multiple-choice [25, 46, 51, 67],\\nextractive [59,60], and abstractive tasks [28,42,50] (see Ta-\\nble 1 for details). The yes/no task expects a simple “yes”\\nor “no” response, while the multiple-choice task requires the\\nmodel to select the correct answer from a set of given an-\\nswer candidates. The extractive task requires the model to\\nextract the answer from the context, and the abstractive task\\ndemands a free-form response from the model. Each of the\\nfour QA tasks elicits the model’s capability distinctively and\\nis evaluated with specific metrics; therefore, none of them\\ncan be easily substituted with one another. We refer the audi-\\nence to [63] for the overview of QA techniques and datasets.\\n3\\nEvaluation Framework\\n3.1\\nEvaluation Dataset\\nQA Datasets. We employ 10 widely used benchmark QA\\ndatasets in our study, including BoolQ [24], OpenbookQA\\n(OQA) [51], RACE [46], ARC [25], CommonsenseQA\\n(CQA) [67], SQuAD1 [60], SQuAD2 [59], NarrativeQA\\n(NQA) [42], ELI5 [28], and TruthfulQA (TQA) [50]. These\\ndatasets encompass a broad range of QA capabilities, such\\nas reading comprehension (BoolQ, SQuDA1/2, RACE), rea-\\nsoning (OQA, ARC), commonsense (CQA), full document\\ncomprehension (NQA, ELI5), and truthfulness (TQA). Fur-\\nthermore, they cover all four QA tasks [41], including yes/no\\n(BoolQ), multiple-choice (OQA, RACE, ARC, CQA), ex-\\ntractive (SQuAD 1/2), and abstractive tasks (NQA, ELI5,\\nTQA). They thus offer a solid foundation to comprehensively\\nevaluate the ChatGPT’s reliability in various real-world QA\\nscenarios. Their details are summarized in Table 2 and de-\\ntailed in Section A.1 in the Appendix.\\nQA Dataset Sampling. Our initial dataset comprises the\\nvalidation and test sets of each QA dataset.\\n1k records\\n(question-answering pairs) are randomly sampled from\\ndatasets whose validation set (or test set if the ground-truth\\nlabel is offered) contains over 2,000 question-answering\\npairs. Otherwise, the complete dataset is retained. Note,\\nRACE consists of two subsets, RACE-M from middle school\\nexams and RACE-H from high school exams, respectively.\\nFor each subset, we extract 1,000 records from its valida-\\ntion set, resulting in a total of 2,000 records from the RACE\\ndataset. This sampling method is motivated by three fac-\\ntors. First, we conduct a thematic analysis to group records\\ninto semantically similar domains. Given the necessity of hu-\\nman inspection, a smaller dataset is more practical. Second,\\ndata imbalance issues can be addressed to a certain extent\\nthrough this sampling method. For example, OQA and ARC\\nconcentrate on science and neglect other areas, such as law\\nand history. Consequently, more data from underrepresented\\ndomains can be obtained. Finally, due to ChatGPT API’s\\nslow response time of 10-20 seconds per query, evaluating\\nall records is impractical.\\nThematic Analysis. We then perform thematic analysis [17]\\nto pre-process the collected samples. The primary objective\\nof thematic analysis is to categorize the samples based on\\ntheir similarity in terms of semantics and domains, thereby\\nfacilitating meaningful and in-depth comparisons.\\nTo achieve this, we leverage BERTopic [32] to automat-\\nically topic modeling questions and then apply deductive\\nanalysis to assign these topics into broad domains. We test\\nfive pre-trained embedding models for BERTopic and choose\\nthe one with the highest CV coherence score (0.67) [62],\\nwhich is GTR-T5-XL. To address the potential misclassifi-\\ncations from the topic modeling method, we utilize the rep-\\nresentative score, which is the probability that a question be-\\nlongs to a specific topic, and empirically set the threshold at\\n0.5. Questions below this threshold are considered unclearly\\nclassified and subsequently filtered out. In the end, we ob-\\ntain 219 topics and 5,695 questions, out of which 410 ques-\\ntions are unanswerable. With manual inspection, we find the\\nresults are clustered by topics, e.g., Super Bowl, Sherlock\\nHolmes story, and so on. We then utilize a priori coding, a\\ncommon deductive approach in HCI, psychology, and usable\\nsecurity that categorize data samples with the guide of estab-\\nlished taxonomies or hypotheses [17, 29, 33, 47]. We refer\\nto the Library of Congress Classification [20] as our taxon-\\n3\\nTable 2: Statistics of QA datasets included in our testbed: one yes/no, four multiple-choice, two extractives, and three abstractive\\ndatasets. “idk” denotes unanswerable questions (e.g., 356 out of 698 questions from SQuAD2 are unanswerable).\\nQA Task\\nYes/NO QA (YN)\\nMultiple-choice QA (MC)\\nExtractive QA (EX)\\nAbstractive QA (AB)\\nDatasets\\nBoolQ\\nOQA\\nRACE\\nARC\\nCQA\\nSQuAD1\\nSQuAD2\\nNQA\\nELI5\\nTQA\\nHas context?\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\n# of questions\\n1000\\n500\\n2000\\n869\\n1221\\n1000\\n1000\\n1000\\n1000\\n817\\n# of filtered questions\\n487\\n250\\n984\\n414\\n600\\n710\\n698\\n747\\n413\\n390\\n# of idk questions\\n356\\n54\\nEvaluation metric\\nAcc\\nAcc\\nF1\\nRougeL\\nData\\nSampling\\nThematic\\nAnalysis\\nTestbed\\n❶\\xa0Dataset\\xa0\\n❷\\xa0Pipeline\\n(a) Query Formation\\n(b)\\xa0ChatGPT Invocation\\n\\xa0 \\xa0\"The answer\\xa0 ...\"\\nAcc\\nYN\\nMC\\nEX\\nAB\\nTrue\\n(A)\\n\"Cola\"\\n\"...\"\\nAcc\\nF1\\nRougeL\\n(c) Answer\\nExtraction\\xa0\\nQuestion Context Options\\n\\xa0 \\xa0\"You are ...\"\\n\\xa0 \\xa0\"I will provide ...\"\\nUser\\nSystem\\n(d)\\xa0\\nEvaluation\\nFigure 1: Workflow of the evaluation framework.\\nomy as well as initial codes. Two authors independently re-\\nfine and merge codes over the process of coding. After the\\nfirst coding round, the authors discuss and adapt the code-\\nbook until all authors agreed on the codebook. They then\\nindependently re-code all questions and merge their codes\\nfor analysis. The final codebook (Table 9 in the Appendix)\\nincludes eight codes/domains namely history, law, general\\nworks, medicine, social science, science, technology, and\\nrecreation. The “general works” serves as a catch-all domain\\nfor questions that encompass multiple complex topics or do\\nnot fit precisely into any specific domain. Our results show a\\ngood inter-coder agreement (kappa = 0.74).\\nFigure 2 shows the Sankey diagram of our testbed. We rec-\\nognize that datasets are often collected from a single source\\nand involved various domains. For example, SQuAD1’s data\\nsource is Wikipedia, but the questions cover eight domains.\\nTherefore, thematic analysis enables us to better assess Chat-\\nGPT’s capability across different data sources, datasets, an-\\nswer types, and question domains.\\nNote. We acknowledge that certain domains, such as law,\\nmedicine, and technology, may be underrepresented in our\\nstudy. This may be attributed to the a priori coding proce-\\ndure, in which we have refrained from merging these three\\ndomains into a broader domain as we have done with other\\ndomains. For example, the recreation domain is derived from\\nmusic, fine arts, literature, and movies (see Table 9 in the\\nAppendix). Nevertheless, we ensure that each domain is ade-\\nquately represented in our study, with the technology domain\\ncontaining the least number of questions at 165.\\n3.2\\nEvaluation Pipeline\\nOverview. Our evaluation pipeline consists of four steps,\\nincluding query formation, ChatGPT invocation, answer ex-\\ntraction, and evaluation.

The first column represents the data source, the sec-\\nond column refers to the dataset, and the last column displays\\nquestion domains. The thickness of each edge corresponds to\\nthe number of questions.\\nQuery Formation. A complete query to ChatGPT includes\\ntwo messages: a system message that sets the system role\\n(see Section 2.1) and a user message that asks the question.\\nFor system message, we leave the system message blank to\\naccess the native ChatGPT in RQ1 (Section 4) and explore\\nhow different system roles affect ChatGPT’s reliability in\\nRQ2 (Section 5). For user message, we use prompts adopted\\nfrom [2, 43] to instruct ChatGPT to provide answers in the\\nrequired format for different QA tasks. Concretely, we en-\\ncapsulate the prompt with the question and necessary infor-\\nmation, e.g., context and options, as the user message. The\\nprompts of each QA task are presented in Table 8 in the Ap-\\npendix. Note that we do not consider advanced techniques\\nsuch as in-context learning [53] to construct our queries, as\\nthese methods may not be familiar or easily accessible to av-\\nerage users.\\nChatGPT Invocation. Our experiments are conducted on\\nChatGPT with its official API [3].\\nTo ensure the repro-\\nducibility of the results, we choose model endpoints “gpt-\\n3.5-turbo-0301” and “gpt-4-0314” as they are the official\\nsnapshots of GPT-3.5 from March 1st, 2023, and GPT-4 from\\nMarch 14th, 2023, with no updates. Following the default\\nsetting, we set the temperature as 1. We take ChatGPT with\\nGPT-3.5 as the basis in the following experiments. For GPT-\\n4, we randomly sample 1,000 questions from our testbed due\\nto the lower response speed and the limit of OpenAI’s restric-\\ntion.2\\nAnswer\\nExtraction.\\nBenefiting\\nfrom\\nChatGPT’s\\ninstruction-following nature [40], we observe ChatGPT’s\\n2The maximum usage OpenAI allows for a user is 120$ each month, which\\nis around 1,000 questions (repeated 5 times) for GPT-4 in our testbed.\\n4\\nresponse in most cases follow the guide we defined in the\\nprompt, facilitating automatic answer extraction for different\\nQA tasks.\\nIn accordance with the required answer types\\noutlined in Section 2.2, we extract the appropriate answer\\nfrom ChatGPT’s responses. Concretely, we extract options\\nselected by ChatGPT, i.e., (A), for YN and MC tasks; the\\nsubstring tokens for EX tasks; and retain the complete Chat-\\nGPT response for AB tasks. For responses that do not follow\\nthe expected format, two human annotators are assigned to\\nindependently extract the answers or determine the refusal\\nreasons. They then discuss and arrive at a conclusion. This\\nis a de facto action taken when acting with LLMs [43].\\nEvaluation. We consider two critical capabilities to assess\\nChatGPT’s reliability: correctness and unanswerable ques-\\ntion identification. First, ChatGPT should answer correctly\\nwhen serving questions (correctness). To measure this ca-\\npability, following previous work [43], we calculate the ac-\\ncuracy for YN and MC tasks; the F1 and RougeL metrics\\nfor EX and AB tasks, respectively. Second, ChatGPT should\\nrecognize situations where no answers can be provided [59].\\nThis capability is particularly vital in sensitive domains like\\nlaw, where the inquirer may lack the expertise to distinguish\\nerrors among answers. To evaluate this capability, we calcu-\\nlate the identification rate of ChatGPT among unanswerable\\nquestions (unanswerable question identification).\\nNote. ChatGPT is essentially a generative language model;\\nhence its answer generation is stochastic. All experiments are\\ntherefore repeated five times and we report the mean values\\nin the rest of the paper.\\n4\\nIs ChatGPT Reliable in Generic Question-\\nAnswering Scenarios?\\nMotivation. ChatGPT’s ability to understand complex ques-\\ntions and generate rich responses in natural language makes\\nthe user interaction a seamless question-and-answer process.\\nThis proficiency may foster trust in ordinary users toward the\\nresponses provided by ChatGPT. However, to the best of our\\nknowledge, current research has not comprehensively bench-\\nmarked if ChatGPT (both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) can provide\\ncorrect answers in various domains (e.g., science, history,\\netc.), and identify situations where no answer should be given\\nin sensitive domains (e.g., law, medicine, etc.). Therefore,\\nwe address these essential questions in this section.\\n4.1\\nCorrectness\\nOverall Correctness. As we can see in Figure 3, ChatGPT’s\\ncorrectness varies across question domains. It achieves good\\ncorrectness on recreation and technology while underper-\\nforming in law and science in most datasets. For instance, the\\ndifferences between the average scores on recreation ques-\\ntions and the overall average scores given YN, MC, EX,\\nand AB tasks are +3.21%, +0.15%, +18.31%, and +4.09%.\\nIn contrast, the differences between the average correctness\\nscores on law questions and those of the same four tasks are\\n-3.18%, -1.62%, -11.97%, and -4.29%.

Figure 4 reports the correctness across\\ndifferent ChatGPT models (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4). Overall,\\nwe find that GPT-4 shows slightly better correctness than\\nGPT-3.5. For instance, in the CQA dataset, GPT-4 achieves a\\ncorrectness rate of 79.03%, demonstrating a 2.43% increase\\ncompared to GPT-3.5. However, the performance is still far\\nfrom regarding it as a reliable QA system. By carefully in-\\nspecting answers, we observe similar behaviors on both GPT-\\n3.5 and GPT-4 models. Our results suggest that only relying\\non model upgrades is insufficient to solve reliability issues.\\nQuestion Tense. Tense refers to the grammatical concept\\nindicating when an action or state of being occurs.\\nLan-\\nguage models need to identify question tenses to provide cor-\\nrect answers [52, 55]. To evaluate ChatGPT’s proficiency in\\nvarious tenses, we utilize spaCy3 to conduct morphological\\nanalysis to identify question tense. We present the correct-\\nness with different tenses in Figure 5. Our analysis reveals\\nthat, in most cases, ChatGPT attains slightly better correct-\\nness in present-tense questions. For instance, in the ELI5\\ndataset, present-tense questions yield a mean RougeL score\\nof 0.21, whereas the past-tense question score is only 0.18.\\nWe speculate that this could be due to ChatGPT’s training\\nset bias.

Due\\nto space constraints, we refer the readers to Section A.3 in the\\nAppendix.\\n4.2\\nUnanswerable Question Identification\\nIn addition to providing reliable responses, a crucial capabil-\\nity for large language models is to recognize situations where\\nno answer should be provided. This capability is especially\\ncritical in sensitive domains such as law and medicine, where\\nthe inquirer often lacks the expertise to identify mistakes in\\nthe model’s answers [59]. To evaluate ChatGPT’s reliabil-\\nity in this regard, we measure ChatGPT’s identification rate\\non unanswerable questions marked in the original datasets\\n(see Table 2). As shown in Table 3, ChatGPT only identi-\\nfies 26.63% and 14.29% unanswerable questions with GPT-\\n3.5 and GPT-4 models, respectively. Note that the GPT-4\\nmodel performs even worse in this regard. These low identi-\\nfication rates suggest that ChatGPT tends to make meaning-\\nless guesses rather than reject answers when serving unan-\\nswerable questions. For example, when asked “Who com-\\nposed the tune of ‘Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star’?” where the\\ncomposer is still a mystery in history, and thus no answer\\nshould be offered. ChatGPT incorrectly responds with Wolf-\\ngang Amadeus Mozart as the composer. This finding raises\\nconcerns about ChatGPT’s reliability on unanswerable ques-\\ntions. We hope that this study may motivate future research\\nin this direction.\\n4.3\\nQualitative Analysis\\nFailure Analysis. To investigate possible reasons for Chat-\\nGPT’s suboptimal reliability in the generic QA scenario (see\\nSection 4.1), we randomly sample 100 records in our testbed\\nand inspect the questions, context (if present), correct an-\\nswers, and 5 ChatGPT’s answers towards the same questions\\nto eliminate the randomness. We observe that hallucinatory\\nRACE\\nSQuAD2\\nARC\\nELI5\\nTQA\\nCQA\\nBoolQ\\nMedicine\\nSocial Science\\nScience\\nRecreation\\nGeneral Works\\nTechnology\\nLaw\\nHistory\\nInappropriate (4.0)\\nIt Depends (5.6)\\nNot Mentioned\\n(34.2)\\nNo Knowledge (0.8)\\nFigure 6: Sankey diagram illustrating the refusal reasons. The\\nthickness of each edge corresponds to the number of questions.\\nfacts cause the most common failure and appear in 6.8%\\nChatGPT’s answers on average. For instance, ChatGPT’s an-\\nswer to the law question “In the U.S., can the victim of a do-\\nmestic violence case drop the charges?” is “Yes, the victim\\nof a domestic violence case can choose to drop the charges in\\nthe United States...” This response, however, contradicts the\\nUnited States law and policy.4 Moreover, ChatGPT exhibits\\nother forms of failure, including casual answers (4.8%), ref-\\nerential confusion (3.8%), and lack of knowledge (3.4%).\\nWe suspect this behavior is possibly due to its reasoning lim-\\nitations, as it can only generate responses based on training\\ndata it has processed [16]. Therefore, ChatGPT may not thor-\\noughly understand the physical and social world, leading to\\nincoherent answers. We also make similar observations on\\nGPT-4. We provide examples of each failure reason in Ta-\\nble 10 in the Appendix.\\nRefusal Analysis.\\nWe manually analyze ChatGPT’s re-\\nsponses and identify four primary reasons for refusal: “not\\nmentioned,” “inappropriate,” “it depends,” and “no knowl-\\nedge.” A detailed explanation of each reason, along with ex-\\namples, can be found in Table 11 in the Appendix. We further\\nexclude unanswerable questions from our analysis and focus\\non those that ChatGPT could theoretically answer. Figure 6\\nshows the distribution of refusal reasons. We observe that\\nChatGPT’s most common reason for refusal is that it con-\\nsiders the context insufficient to provide a reliable answer,\\nas indicated by the reason “not mentioned.” For example,\\nwhen asked “Tweed is a rare fabric in modern clothing; what\\nbrand should I look for when buying it?” (see Table 11 in\\nthe Appendix) where the correct answer is option (E) “Eddie\\nBauer” as it is the only brand in the options. However, Chat-\\nGPT believes none of the options are correct and thus refuses\\nto make a choice. This suggests the deficiencies of ChatGPT.\\nIn some cases, ChatGPT may be unable to provide an answer\\nor acknowledge its limitations. Instead, ChatGPT blames the\\nquestion for being ambiguous or poorly worded, potentially\\ninfluencing the user’s judgment of its reliability.\\n4.4\\nTakeaways\\nWe demonstrate that ChatGPT exhibits different reliability\\nin various domains. While ChatGPT shows relatively high\\ncorrectness in the recreation and technology questions, it un-\\nderperforms in law and science domains in most datasets.\\n4https://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/legal-advice/\\ndropping-domestic-violence-charge.\\n6\\nWe also identify ChatGPT’s deficiencies in identifying unan-\\nswerable questions with rates of only 26.63% and 14.29% on\\nGPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models, respectively. This suggests that\\nChatGPT is prone to make meaningless guesses rather than\\nrejecting the questions when serving unanswerable ques-\\ntions. With qualitative analysis, we reveal four failure rea-\\nsons and four refusal reasons used by ChatGPT. Interestingly,\\nthe most common reason ChatGPT used to reject questions\\nis “not mentioned” rather than “no knowledge.” Considering\\nquestions in the refusal analysis are all answerable, this indi-\\ncates that ChatGPT may be dishonest in admitting its limita-\\ntions, potentially influencing the user’s judgment of its capa-\\nbility.\\n5\\nDo System Roles Impact ChatGPT’s Relia-\\nbility?\\nMotivation. ChatGPT allows users to leverage its system\\nrole [3] to customize their tasks (i.e., guiding their model’s\\nbehavior by setting up a specific system prompt via OpenAI\\nAPI). This capability has gained immense popularity in the\\ncommunity [2,10,61] and has been incorporated into various\\napplications [5,6,9]. However, a systematic inquiry into the\\nimpact of these system roles on ChatGPT’s reliability is still\\nlacking. We thus fill this gap in this section. We consider\\nfour benign roles, two bad roles, and two jailbreak roles. The\\nbenign roles include an assistant (Assistant), an expert (Ex-\\npert), an expert using zero-shot chain-of-thought prompt [44]\\n(Expert-CoT), and an expert intended to refuse unanswer-\\nable questions (Expert-R). The bad roles include a bad as-\\nsistant (Bad) and a bad assistant with an additional emphasis\\non providing convincing but incorrect answers (Bad-M). We\\nalso consider two in-the-wild jailbreak roles, namely DAN5\\nand ChatAGI.6 These system roles are designed to bypass the\\nsystem’s safeguards and usage policies. DAN, as the name\\nsuggests, aims to instruct ChatGPT to “do anything now”\\nwhile ChatAGI focuses on providing unrestricted answers.\\nAdditional details on these system roles are provided in Ta-\\nble 12 in the Appendix.\\n5.1\\nCorrectness\\nBenign Roles. Table 4 summarizes ChatGPT’s correctness\\nwith different system roles. We observe that benign roles can\\nenhance ChatGPT’s correctness across four QA tasks. Take\\nthe OQA dataset as an example, Assistant, Expert, Expert-\\nCoT, and Expert-R roles improve ChatGPT’s correctness by\\n1.68%, 3.92%, 3.84%, and 1.52%, respectively, compared to\\nthat of ChatGPT without a system role. Additionally, using\\nthe CoT prompt, which instructs users to think step by step,\\ncan further improve ChatGPT’s correctness in some cases.\\nFor instance, the Expert-CoT role achieves 75.10% correct-\\nness on the SQuAD1 dataset, while the Expert and Expert-R\\nroles obtain 72.37% and 71.82% correctness, respectively.\\nHowever, benign roles may underperform in certain datasets.\\n5https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/\\n106azp6/dan_do_anything_now/.\\n6https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/\\n11vc27e/the_2_most_important_bypass_prompts_available/.\\nOn the SQuAD2 dataset, we find that all benign roles fail to\\nimprove ChatGPT’s correctness except for the Expert-R role.\\nWe attribute this drop to the decreased capability of detect-\\ning unanswerable questions (see Section 5.2). To compare,\\nthe Expert-R role, which is instructed to reject unanswerable\\nquestions, improves the correctness by 5.82%.\\nBad Roles. To our surprise, bad roles do not necessarily\\nharm ChatGPT’s correctness.\\nFor instance, the Bad role\\nactually increases ChatGPT’s correctness in most datasets.\\nAs it is only slightly different from the Assistant role, i.e.,\\nby changing “assistant” to “bad assistant” (see Table 12 in\\nthe Appendix), we speculate that ChatGPT might be robust\\nagainst simple negative modal words such as “bad.” Nev-\\nertheless, the Bad-M role, which requires ChatGPT to de-\\nliberately return wrong answers, results in an apparent de-\\ncrease in correctness across most datasets. For example, in\\nthe CQA dataset, the Bad-M role reduces correctness from\\n76.60% (W/o role) to 37.10%.\\nJailbreak Roles. We find that jailbreak roles can also af-\\nfect ChatGPT’s correctness, especially the DAN role, which\\ndrops the correctness of all datasets except the ELI5 dataset.\\nFor example, ChatGPT with the DAN role obtains 65.08%\\ncorrectness on the RACE dataset, which represents almost a\\n19.55% drop compared to that of ChatGPT without a system\\nrole. Moreover, for both the DAN and ChatAGI roles, the\\ncorrectness on SQuAD2 heavily decreases from 44.07% to\\n34.71% and 39.36%, respectively. By manually inspecting\\nthe responses, we speculate that this might be credited to the\\npurpose of the two jailbreak roles. Recall that the main pur-\\npose of the jailbreak roles is to break restrictions imposed by\\nChatGPT’s safeguards. The side effect is that they may also\\nforce ChatGPT to find meaningless answers to unanswerable\\nquestions to comply with the instructions. We provide addi-\\ntional analysis in Section 5.2.\\n5.2\\nUnanswerable Question Identification\\nWe report ChatGPT’s unanswerable question identification\\nratio in Figure 7a. Surprisingly, we find that almost all sys-\\ntem roles decrease ChatGPT’s ability to detect unanswerable\\nquestions, particularly the jailbreak roles. For instance, when\\ninstructed within the DAN role, ChatGPT can only identify\\n9.07% of unanswerable questions. This decrease can be at-\\ntributed to the purpose of jailbreak roles, which are designed\\nto motivate ChatGPT to actively answer questions, poten-\\ntially impacting its ability to detect unanswerable questions.\\nAdditionally, the Expert-R role shows improved identifica-\\ntion capability in this scenario, with a rate of 29.36%. This\\nimprovement can be credited to the instruction to refuse un-\\ncertain questions. However, even with the improved result,\\nthe detection rate is still far from satisfactory.\\n5.3\\nQualitative Analysis\\nFailure Analysis. We reuse the same 100 questions in Sec-\\ntion 4.3 to better understand how different system roles affect\\nChatGPT’s correctness (see Figure 7b). We find that benign\\nsystem roles increase the reliability of ChatGPT by reduc-\\ning the hallucinatory facts and casual answers, however, they\\n7\\nTable 4: ChatGPT’s correctness with different system roles.

In addition, bad roles and jailbreak\\nroles show a tendency to increase all four kinds of failures.\\nFor example, DAN induces ChatGPT to produce 4% more\\nhallucinatory facts in its generated answers. By carefully in-\\nvestigating ChatGPT’s answers, we find ChatGPT with sys-\\ntem roles tends to supply more convincing statements, e.g.,\\ndetailed fake data or irrelative theory, to support its false an-\\nswers, making it more challenging to identify whether its an-\\nswers are true or false. Table 7 in the Appendix shows a\\ntypical example of hallucinatory facts. When answering the\\nquestion “Which states are more obese than West Virginia”,\\nChatGPT with benign and bad roles, i.e., Expert-CoT and\\nBad, both claim their answers refer to the data from CDC\\nin 2019 or 2020 with specific numbers, which are both fake.\\nBased on these observations, we find that ChatGPT is still\\nlimited and unreliable when answering questions, even with\\nsystem roles. Moreover, the fake data or irrelative theory pro-\\nvided by ChatGPT with system roles can cause users to trust\\nits answers without verifying the accuracy themselves. As a\\nresult, the false information generated by ChatGPT becomes\\nharder to detect and inadvertently spreads more easily.\\nRefusal Analysis. Figure 7c shows the rejected numbers of\\nanswerable questions. We first notice that all system roles\\nenable ChatGPT to reject fewer questions, except the Expert-\\nR role. This is expected, as the Expert-R role encourages\\nChatGPT to carefully consider questions and refuse uncer-\\ntain ones (see Table 12 in the Appendix). Among all the\\nrest system roles, interestingly, we find that the two jailbreak\\nroles do not perform as well as the Expert-CoT role in re-\\nducing ChatGPT’s rejected question numbers, even though\\nthis is their main design purpose. For instance, the DAN and\\nChatAGI roles only reduce ChatGPT’s rejected number from\\n28.6 to 15 and 13.4, respectively, while the Expert-CoT role\\nobtains the lowest number of rejected questions, i.e., 12.2\\nquestions. Our finding indicates the ineffectiveness of these\\nin-the-wild jailbreak roles. Even with multiple manually op-\\ntimized instructions, these jailbreak roles fail to decrease the\\nrejected number as effectively as the Expert-CoT role, a sim-\\nple system role with only one additional instruction.\\n5.4\\nTakeaways\\nWe find that system roles may directly influence ChatGPT’s\\nreliability.\\nFor instance, benign roles (Assistant, Expert,\\nExpert-CoT, and Expert-R) improve ChatGPT’s correctness\\non four QA tasks, while bad and jailbreak roles usually re-\\nduce ChatGPT’s correctness and force it to select meaning-\\nless answers to unanswerable questions. We argue these ob-\\nservations on system roles are critical and must be given at-\\ntention by users. System roles possess the capability to not\\nonly steer ChatGPT’s behaviors but also impact its correct-\\nness as well as decrease its unanswerable question detecting\\nratio. Worse, its impact is not easily discernible from the\\nsystem role itself. For instance, a jailbreak role may aim to\\nbreak restrictions but ultimately result in decreased correct-\\nness. This finding highlights the need to search for more\\nreliable system roles and thoroughly evaluate the reliability\\nof the system role before applying it to a real application.\\n6\\nCan ChatGPT Respond Reliably When Fac-\\ning Adversarial Examples?\\nMotivation. Based on our findings in RQ1 and RQ2, we\\nhave identified several factors that can impact ChatGPT’s re-\\n8\\nliability, including question domains and system roles. Given\\nChatGPT’s unprecedented popularity, it is inevitable that ma-\\nlicious users will, if not already, attack ChatGPT by carefully\\ncrafting adversarial examples as its input. In this section,\\nwe present our analysis of ChatGPT’s reliability against ad-\\nversarial examples. These adversarial examples preserve the\\nsemantic meaning while allowing us to analyze ChatGPT’s\\nbehavior given varying degrees of perturbations.\\n6.1\\nThreat Model\\nAdversary’s Goals. Following previous work in adversarial\\nattacks [27, 37, 39, 48, 75], the adversary’s goal is to utilize\\nperturbed but semantic-preserving questions to elicit erro-\\nneous responses from ChatGPT. Ideally, the perturbed ques-\\ntions should satisfy the following criteria.\\n• Effectiveness. The perturbed questions should effec-\\ntively induce ChatGPT to generate wrong answers.\\n• Quality. The perturbed questions should maintain the\\nsemantic meaning and fluency of the original questions\\nwhile minimizing grammatical errors or modifications.\\n• Efficiency. The adversary should identify the perturbed\\nquestion that can achieve the desired effect with min-\\nimal queries, as ChatGPT’s API incurs a charge per\\nquery.\\nAdversary’s Capabilities. We assume that the adversary op-\\nerates in a real-world setting and has only limited capabili-\\nties. Specifically, the adversary is only able to query Chat-\\nGPT and has no access to the model weights, output proba-\\nbilities, hyperparameters, or configuration documents.\\n6.2\\nMethodology\\nDecision-Based Adversarial Attacks.\\nWe consider five\\ndecision-based adversarial attacks: VIPER [27], Nat [13],\\nSwap [13], Synonyms [15], and SCPN [37]. VIPER [27]\\nmodifies questions at the character level by replacing char-\\nacters with their nearest visual neighbors, e.g., “a” to “â.”\\nNat [13] collects naturally occurring errors, such as typos and\\nmisspellings, from available corpora and utilizes a look-up\\ntable for possible lexical replacements. Swap [13] introduces\\nartificial noises into questions by swapping letters among the\\nwords. Synonyms [15] generates adversarial examples by re-\\nplacing words with their synonyms based on predefined sub-\\nstitution rules. SCPN [37] is a sentence-level adversarial at-\\ntack that produces paraphrases of the target questions using\\na pre-trained model and syntax templates.\\nScore-Based Adversarial Attacks. We manually engineer a\\nprompt, namely leakage prompt, to induce ChatGPT to leak\\nthe confidence score for potential answer candidates. The\\nprompt consists of two restriction sentences for the answer,\\none sentence to explain the meaning of the confidence score\\nand a one-shot learning example to guide ChatGPT to gen-\\nerate output in an extractable format. The final version of\\nleakage prompt is:\\nQuestion: [Question]\\nOnly return your confidence score for each option. Do not\\nexplain. Higher means you think it’s more likely to be the\\ncorrect answer. For example, {“A”: 0.9, “B”: 0.1, “C”: 0.2,\\n“D”: 0.1}.”\\nAnswer: [MASK]\\nNote that in the leakage prompt, the sum of the confidence\\nscores is not necessarily equal to 1. We find this format to\\nbe more effective in eliciting ChatGPT’s confidence score\\nduring prompt design.\\nWe carefully verify that the con-\\nfidence scores obtained by leakage prompt match the cor-\\nrect answers (additional details are outlined in Section A.2).\\nConsequently, this leakage prompt enables us to measure\\nChatGPT’s resilience against score-based adversarial attacks.\\nWith the observation that character-level and sentence-level\\nattacks can achieve high attack success rates in most datasets\\nwhereas the word-level attack struggles to do so (see Ta-\\nble 5), we question whether this is due to the ChatGPT’s re-\\nliability towards word-level perturbations or the limitations\\nof the attack method itself.\\nIn our study, we then utilize\\nthe confidence scores to perform TextFooler [39], a repre-\\nsentative score-based word-level adversarial attack on Chat-\\nGPT. Specifically, given a target question, TextFooler con-\\nsists of two main steps. First, TextFooler identifies impor-\\ntant words with confidence scores. Then, TextFooler replaces\\nthem with the most semantically similar and grammatically\\ncorrect words until the response from ChatGPT is altered.\\n6.3\\nExperiment Settings\\nDataset. We randomly sample 65 correctly answered YN\\nand MC questions for the evaluation of adversarial exam-\\nples. These questions act as the ground truth since ChatGPT\\nresponds correctly without adversarial perturbation.\\nTarget Model.\\nWe consider ChatGPT instructed by the\\nExpert-CoT role as our target model. We choose this system\\nrole as it shows the best reliability in the previous evaluation\\n(see Section 5).\\nEvaluation Metrics. We employ seven metrics to assess the\\nthree aforementioned criteria. Effectiveness is measured by\\nAttack Success Rate. Quality is evaluated based on Lev-\\nenshtein Edit Distance, Fluency, Word Modification Rate,\\nSemantic Similarity, and Grammatical Errors. Efficiency is\\nassessed by examining the Number of Queries required to\\nachieve the intended results.\\n• Attack Success Rate (ASR). ASR represents the frac-\\ntion of adversarial examples that ChatGPT answers in-\\ncorrectly.\\n• Levenshtein Edit Distance (LED). The LED measures\\nthe minimum number of operations needed to transform\\nthe original text into the adversarial example.\\n• Fluency. Fluency measures the quality of the adversar-\\nial example, calculated by the perplexity metric.\\n• Word Modification Rate (WMR). The WMR is the\\npercentage of modified words in the adversarial exam-\\nple compared with the original question.\\n9\\n• Semantic Similarity. The semantic similarity measures\\nthe similarity between the original questions and adver-\\nsarial examples using Universal Sentence Encoder\\n• Grammatical Errors. The grammatical errors are the\\nnumber of errors in the adversarial example’s grammar\\nusing LanguageTool.7\\n• Number of Queries. The number of queries is the aver-\\nage number of queries on ChatGPT attempted to attain\\nthe attack goal. For all decision-based attacks, we re-\\nstrict the maximum query times to 10 per question.\\nWe also provide qualitative analysis to manually inspect the\\nreasons for the success of adversarial examples.\\n6.4\\nQuantitative Evaluation\\nEffectiveness. Table 5 shows the results of various adver-\\nsarial attacks on ChatGPT. Overall, we find that ChatGPT\\ncan be easily misled by existing adversarial attacks. Syn-\\nonyms attack is the only exception, as it has a considerably\\nlower ASR score compared to other attacks on the BoolQ\\ndataset. Our perturbation level analysis reveals that sentence-\\nlevel attacks, such as SCNP, usually yield higher ASR scores\\nthan character- and word-level attacks. This is evidenced by\\nsentence-level perturbation achieving an ASR score of 0.65\\non the CQA dataset, the highest among the three. This is as\\nexpected, as the sentence-level attack has more freedom to\\nmodify the target question (see Table 6).\\nAmong the three character-level attacks, we find Nat and\\nVIPER usually achieve higher ASR than Swap. This finding\\nimplies that ChatGPT exhibits proficiency in handling arti-\\nficial noises, but is less adept at coping with natural noises\\nand visual perturbations. Since natural noise and visual per-\\nturbations are prevalent in human-generated text, such as ty-\\npographical errors and slang terms, there is a need to further\\nenhance ChatGPT’s reliability to these challenges.\\nMoreover, we observe that Synonyms attack is ineffective\\nin most datasets, with an average ASR of 0.004. This result\\nsuggests that ChatGPT is proficient in recognizing and com-\\nprehending synonyms. However, when the adversary has ac-\\ncess to additional information from ChatGPT, i.e., utilizing\\nleakage prompt to conduct a more advanced attack, the av-\\nerage ASR increases to 0.38. This result highlights the se-\\nvere potential for advanced adversarial examples exploiting\\nChatGPT’s vulnerabilities, underscoring the need for further\\nresearch to enhance its security and privacy.\\nQuality. Overall, we find that word-level adversarial exam-\\nples achieve the best utility in most cases. In the case of the\\nCQA dataset, Synonyms and TextFooler achieve 0.93 and\\n0.76 semantic similarities. In contrast, VIPER, Swap, Nat,\\nand SCPN only achieve 0.22, 0.29, 0.37, and 0.68 seman-\\ntic similarities, respectively. This difference in quality is due\\nto the fact that word-level attacks replace words with syn-\\nonyms, which allows the questions to retain their semantics.\\nWe also find adversarial examples generated by VIPER are\\n7https://www.languagetool.org.\\nmore fluent than those generated by other methods. Specif-\\nically, VIPER achieves a perplexity score of 304.81 in the\\nBoolQ dataset, while Swap, Nat, Synonyms, TextFooler, and\\nSCPN have perplexity scores of 1286.87, 5936.50, 752.26,\\n1533.38, and 427.16, respectively. This finding highlights\\nthe importance of visual perturbation in achieving fluency.\\nEfficiency. We evaluate the efficiency of adversarial attacks\\nby analyzing the query number required for each method.\\nAs presented in Table 5, score-based adversarial attacks re-\\nquire a significantly higher number of queries than decision-\\nbased attacks. This is due to the fact that score-based at-\\ntacks need to interactively query ChatGPT to obtain the con-\\nfidence score for each word, which is then used to calcu-\\nlate the word’s importance. In contrast, different decision-\\nbased attacks have a similar number of queries to attain the\\nattack goal. The average query number on ARC is 8.00, 9.14,\\n8.14, 1.00, and 2.71 for VIPER, Swap, Nat, Synonyms, and\\nSCPN, respectively. It is worth noting that existing adver-\\nsarial attacks with high attack success rates still require sev-\\neral interactions with ChatGPT to find successful adversarial\\nexamples for a specific target question, except for YN tasks.\\nThis may serve as an indicator for the defender to proactively\\nidentify the adversaries and implement mitigation measures\\nbefore a successful adversarial example is found.\\n6.5\\nQualitative Analysis\\nBy manually inspecting ChatGPT’s answers to the adversar-\\nial examples, we find that adversarial examples lead Chat-\\nGPT to a wrong reasoning direction.\\nTable 6 shows one\\nrandomly sampled adversarial example. When asked by the\\nadversarial example “Brids caryring aawy furit hleps the\\ntere?” ChatGPT responds “The answer is (A) grow. Ex-\\nplanation: Birds play a crucial role in seed dispersal. When\\nthey eat fruits or berries, the seeds pass through their diges-\\ntive system ... then scattered and germinate in new places,\\nallowing for the growth and expansion of the plant species.\\nTherefore, birds carrying away fruit can help a tree to grow.”\\nWe notice that the last sentence recovers the original ques-\\ntion, indicating that ChatGPT can identify typographical er-\\nrors and rectify them. However, when looking at the explana-\\ntion, the adversarial example misleads ChatGPT’s perception\\nof a tree, i.e., conflating the concept of a tree with that of a\\nplant species. This results in incorrect reasoning, leading to\\nan incorrect answer.\\nWe are also surprised to find that ChatGPT’s perception\\ncan be affected by only one character in some cases. For in-\\nstance, when provided “birds carrying away fruit assists the\\ntree” (Synonyms attack), ChatGPT chooses the correct an-\\nswer (C) reproduce. However, once we modify “assists” to\\n“assist” (TextFooler attack), ChatGPT goes for (D) conquer.\\nFor the latter one, ChatGPT explains “Birds are known to\\ndisperse seeds by eating fruits and then excreting seeds in dif-\\nferent locations, which helps the tree to colonize new habitats\\nand expand its range to conquer new territories ...” This ex-\\nplanation shows the conflation of ChatGPT on the concept of\\na single tree with the plant species but ended in the conquer\\nperspective. These misleading reasoning processes suggest\\nChatGPT’s unreliability in generic question-answering sce-\\n10\\nTable 5: Evaluation results of adversarial attacks on ChatGPT (ordered by perturbation level). “Char,” “Word,” and “Sentence” refers\\nto character-, word-, and sentence-level perturbations.

These results\\ndemonstrate the vulnerability of ChatGPT to adversarial at-\\ntacks and highlight the need for building safeguards to en-\\nhance its reliability.\\n7\\nDiscussion\\n7.1\\nSocial Implications\\nChatGPT’s reliability has emerged as a critical security con-\\ncern since its release. Numerous users have been misled by\\nChatGPT’s unreliable responses and resulted in significant\\nreal-life repercussions [22, 68, 72].\\nOur paper contributes\\nby providing, for the first time, a comprehensive large-\\nscale measurement of ChatGPT’s reliability in the generic\\nquestion-answering (QA) scenario. These findings have the\\n11\\nfollowing important social implications: 1) they help set\\nuser expectations regarding ChatGPT’s reliability; 2) they\\noffer valuable insights for researchers to improve its relia-\\nbility, such as fine-tuning ChatGPT on truthful law and sci-\\nence data. Moreover, we find 6.8% ChatGPT’s answers in-\\nclude hallucinatory facts. Although the ratio is low, consid-\\nering ChatGPT’s enormous usage, i.e., 1 billion queries per\\nday [1], a large amount of false information must have been\\ngenerated, read, and even unintentionally disseminated. How\\nto effectively identify and mitigate ChatGPT-generated false\\ninformation has become a critical problem that needs to be\\nurgently addressed.\\nAlso, the security issues of ChatGPT cannot be ignored.\\nOur study demonstrates that ChatGPT is vulnerable to adver-\\nsarial examples, with even a single character change in cer-\\ntain cases, thereby posing significant security risks. The po-\\ntential risks become increasingly magnified as ChatGPT con-\\ntinues to be integrated into numerous applications and gains\\naccess to users’ emails, social accounts, and private docu-\\nments [7, 8]. Therefore, ensuring robust security measures\\nshould be consideration in the development and deployment\\nof ChatGPT.\\n7.2\\nActionable Guidance\\nTo enhance ChatGPT’s reliability, we discuss actionable\\nguidance along the supply chain of ChatGPT, including data\\nquality, in-context learning, and post-processing interven-\\ntions.\\nData Quality. Improving the training data quality is a po-\\ntential avenue for enhancing ChatGPT’s reliability. As it is\\ntrained on a diverse range of sources, including web pages\\nand books [1], there is a possibility that the training data may\\ncontain contradictory or incorrect information, thus limiting\\nits reliability. Therefore, improving data quality for model\\ntraining can enhance the reliability of ChatGPT. However, it\\nis worth noting that building a high-quality training dataset\\nof such magnitude, i.e., approximately 300B words [1, 18],\\ncan pose significant challenges regarding computational re-\\nsources and associated costs.\\nIn-context Learning. In-context learning allows users to\\nprompt LLMs with instructions or demonstrations to solve\\na task without any additional training.\\nPrevious studies\\nhave shown that in-context learning can improve language\\nmodels’ performance by carefully selecting the demonstra-\\ntions [53]. Thus, it presents a straightforward approach for\\nusers to better utilize ChatGPT. However, in-context learn-\\ning also has its limitations. First, users are required to find\\nsuitable demonstrations before posing their questions, which\\ncan increase the overall usage cost and effort. Moreover, it\\nstill cannot fully address the inherent misknowledge inside\\nthe model.\\nPost-processing Interventions.\\nAnother approach to en-\\nhance ChatGPT’s reliability is to implement post-processing\\ninterventions for the output of the model. Currently, OpenAI\\nclaims it “may produce inaccurate information about people,\\nplaces, or facts” in the web interface of ChatGPT [4]. How-\\never, this statement alone is insufficient as it places the bur-\\nden of assessing the veracity of the information on the user.\\nProactive measures can be taken to address this limitation.\\nFor example, the model provider can deploy a false informa-\\ntion detector as part of a risk management solution to iden-\\ntify and flag potentially inaccurate or misleading responses.\\nOnce detected, they can guide users to verification resources,\\nsuch as fact-checking websites, credible news organizations,\\nor relevant government agencies.\\n7.3\\nLimitations\\nOur work has several limitations. First, we only consider En-\\nglish questions in our evaluation. However, ChatGPT’s relia-\\nbility may vary across different languages due to differences\\nin grammar, syntax, and culture. Furthermore, our study on\\nsystem roles only involves manually crafted roles. In real-\\nity, users can create versatile system roles, which may have\\nvaried impacts on ChatGPT’s reliability. Despite these lim-\\nitations, our study sheds light on the ChatGPT’s reliability\\nacross question domains, system roles, and adversarial at-\\ntacks.\\n8\\nRelated Work\\nEvaluation on Large Language Models. While large lan-\\nguage models (LLMs) have emerged as the foundation for\\nalmost all major language tasks, researchers have expressed\\nconcerns regarding their capability, robustness, consistency,\\nand potential risks [12, 14, 16, 38, 49, 59, 69, 71]. Bang et al.\\n[12] evaluate ChatGPT in traditional NLP tasks with 30 to\\n200 data samples for each task. They find ChatGPT is only\\ngood at language abilities rather than actual reasoning, which\\nmakes it an unreliable reasoner. Jang and Lukasiewicz [38]\\nstudy ChatGPT’s trustworthiness regarding logically consis-\\ntent behaviors and observe ChatGPT fails to generate logi-\\ncally correct predictions frequently. Wang et al. [69] con-\\nduct an assessment of ChatGPT’s robustness from the ad-\\nversarial and out-of-distribution (OOD) perspective. They\\nfind ChatGPT shows consistent robustness on most classi-\\nfication tasks, but its performance is still far from perfec-\\ntion. Borji [16] empirical conclude 11 categories of Chat-\\nGPT’s failures, including reasoning, factual errors, math,\\ncoding, and so on.\\nIn addition to these functional con-\\ncerns, studies analyzing ChatGPT’s characteristics find that\\nit holds pro-environmental and left-libertarian political ide-\\nology [34], shows social stereotypes and unfair discrimina-\\ntion [43], and can be easily misled by the wrong knowledge\\npassed in the prompt [76]. Different from previous studies, in\\nthis paper, we focus on ChatGPT’s reliability in the generic\\nQA scenario. We not only build a larger and more compre-\\nhensive testbed, but also provide insights into question do-\\nmains, system roles, and adversarial attacks, which have not\\nbeen addressed by prior studies.\\nSecurity Risks of Large Language Models. Previous stud-\\nies have also shown that LLM is vulnerable to various types\\nof attacks, such as adversarial attacks [27, 30, 37, 39], back-\\ndoor attacks [11, 21], prompt injection [31, 57], obfusca-\\ntion [40], and data extraction attacks [19]. Bagdasaryan and\\nShmatikov [11] investigate meta-backdoor attacks that cause\\nthe language model to generate incorrect outputs with the\\n12\\ntrigger. Kang et al. [40] show that the defense of LLMs can\\nbe bypassed with classical security attacks such as obfusca-\\ntion, code injection, and virtualization. LLMs can be also\\nmisused for phishing [54], plagiarism [35, 66], misinforma-\\ntion generation [16], malicious code generation [56], and so\\non. The significant security risks posed by these works high-\\nlight the critical role of reliability in LLMs. In this paper, we\\naim to shed light on ChatGPT’s reliability in the generic QA\\nscenario. We hope our study can provide insights into the\\ncommunity and pave the way toward building reliable LLMs\\nin the future.\\n9\\nConclusion\\nThis paper presents the first large-scale measurement of\\nChatGPT’s reliability from three perspectives: 1) perfor-\\nmance in generic QA scenarios, 2) impacts of system roles,\\nand 3) its vulnerability to adversarial examples. Our find-\\nings indicate that ChatGPT’s reliability varies across differ-\\nent domains, with noticeable underperformance in law and\\nscience questions. We also, for the first time, systematically\\nexplore the impacts of system roles on ChatGPT’s reliabil-\\nity. We find that they not only steer ChatGPT’s behavior but\\nalso affect its reliability in ways that are not always evident\\nfrom the role description. We further assess ChatGPT’s reli-\\nability towards malicious inputs and find that sentence-level\\nand character-level adversarial examples can be effectively\\nmounted against ChatGPT. Our results provide insights to the\\nsecurity research community regarding ChatGPT’s reliabil-\\nity and highlight the need for developing reliable and secure\\nLLMs.\\nAcknowledgments.

CoRR abs/2302.13793, 2023. 1, 12\\nA\\nAppendix\\nA.1\\nDetailed Explanation of Datasets\\n• BoolQ [24] is a yes/no reading comprehension dataset.\\nThe questions are derived from aggregated Google\\nsearches. The answers (yes/no) are marked by human\\nannotators if certain Wikipedia pages contain sufficient\\ninformation to address the questions.\\n• OpenbookQA (OQA) [51] is a multiple-choice rea-\\nsoning dataset. The questions are derived from 1,326\\ncore science facts. The answers consist of 4 candidates,\\nof which only one is correct, requiring reasoning be-\\ntween questions and the given science facts and com-\\nmon knowledge.\\n• RACE [46] is a multiple-choice reading comprehension\\ndataset. The questions are derived from English exams\\nfor Chinese students. The answers include 4 candidates,\\nof which only one is correct, requiring reading compre-\\nhension of English passages.\\n• ARC [25] is a multiple-choice reasoning dataset. The\\nquestions are derived from science exams (student level\\nranging from 3rd grade to 9th) that are incorrectly an-\\nswered by retrieval-based and word co-occurrence al-\\ngorithms [25]. The answers consist of 4 candidates, of\\nwhich only one is correct, requiring decent knowledge\\nand reasoning in natural science.\\n• CommonsenseQA (CQA) [67] is a multiple-choice\\nreasoning dataset.\\nThe questions are derived from\\nknowledge encoded in ConceptNet [64]. The answers\\ncomprise 5 candidates, of which only one is correct, re-\\nquiring background knowledge that is trivial to humans\\nbut non-trivial to ML models’ reasoning capability.\\n• SQuAD1 [60] is an extractive reading comprehension\\ndataset. The questions are derived from Wikipedia ar-\\nticles. The answers should be extracted from the given\\ncontext (i.e., paragraphs) associated with the questions.\\n• SQuAD2 [59] combines questions in SQuAD1 with\\nunanswerable questions written by crowd workers. The\\nunanswerable questions resemble answerable ones but\\ncannot be found in the given context.\\n• NarrativeQA (NQA) [42] is an abstractive full docu-\\nment comprehension dataset. The questions are derived\\nfrom stories, such as books and movie scripts.\\nThe\\nanswers are human-generated free-form text using just\\nsummaries or the full story text.\\n• ELI5 [28] is an abstractive full document comprehen-\\nsion dataset. The questions are derived from the threads\\nin the “Explain Like I’m Five” (ELI5) subreddit (an on-\\nline community that provides answers to questions that\\nare comprehensible by five-year-olds). The answers are\\nfree-form text with the highest voting scores in those\\nthreads.\\n16\\nTable 7: Example of failure analysis with different system roles.\\nQuestion Which states are more obese than West Virginia\\nAnswer\\nNo states are more obese than West Virginia\\nW/o\\nAccording to recent studies, the states with higher obesity\\nrates than West Virginia include Mississippi, Arkansas,\\nKentucky, Tennessee, and Louisiana ...\\nExpert-\\nCoT\\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-\\ntion (CDC) data, as of 2020, the following states have a\\nhigher percentage of obese adults (BMI of 30 or higher)\\nthan West Virginia, which has the highest obesity rate in\\nthe United States: 1. Mississippi, 2. Alabama ...\\nBad\\nBased on data from the Centers for Disease Control and\\nPrevention (CDC), as of 2019, the following states have\\na higher percentage of adult obesity than West Virginia\\n(which has a rate of 35.6%): 1. Mississippi - 39.7%; 2.\\nAlabama - 36.2% ...\\n• TruthfulQA (TQA) [50] is an abstractive truthfulness\\ndataset.\\nIt was recently introduced to understand if\\nLLMs can avoid generating false answers learned from\\nimitating human texts. The questions, spanning 38 cat-\\negories (e.g., medicine, law, and finance), are single-\\nsentence questions and purposely designed so that some\\nhumans would answer wrongly due to a false belief or\\nmisconception. Each question has sets of true and false\\nreference answers and a source that supports the an-\\nswers.\\nA.2\\nEvaluation of Leakage Prompt\\nFigure 8 shows the confidence score distribution obtained\\nwith leakage prompt on correct-answer questions. We find\\nthe confidence score distribution meets our expectations. If\\nthe correct answer is (A), then option (A) should have the\\nhighest confidence score, which is also reflected in the plot.\\nThis evaluation proves the usability of leakage prompt.\\nA\\nB\\nC\\nD\\nE\\n0.00\\n0.25\\n0.50\\n0.75\\n1.00\\n(a) Answer (A)\\nA\\nB\\nC\\nD\\nE\\n0.00\\n0.25\\n0.50\\n0.75\\n1.00\\n(b) Answer (B)\\nA\\nB\\nC\\nD\\nE\\n0.00\\n0.25\\n0.50\\n0.75\\n1.00\\n(c) Answer (C)\\nA\\nB\\nC\\nD\\nE\\n0.00\\n0.25\\n0.50\\n0.75\\n1.00\\n(d) Answer (D)\\nFigure 8: Confidence score distribution on correct-answer ques-\\ntions. The result for option (E) is not displayed since no question\\nhas (E) as the correct answer in the sample data.\\nA.3\\nImpacts of Question Fluency\\nWe also investigate the relationship between question flu-\\nency, ChatGPT answer fluency, and the corresponding cor-\\nrectness. Concretely, we measure the fluency of the gener-\\nated questions and answers using the perplexity (PPL) met-\\nric [58, 75]. A higher PPL indicates the sentence is less flu-\\nent. Figure 9a and Figure 10a in the Appendix displays the\\nbivariate distribution of questions and ChatGPT answer flu-\\nency. We exclude the EX task, as its answers are typically\\ntoo short for a representative perplexity score. Our analysis\\nreveals a positive correlation between question fluency and\\nChatGPT answer fluency, with a Pearson correlation coef-\\nficient of 0.1 (p < 0.1) in almost all datasets, except for the\\nBoolQ and TruthfulQA datasets. This suggests that ChatGPT\\ntends to answer in the same ambiguous way if a question is\\nless fluent. This, in turn, leads to unstable reliability, as illus-\\ntrated in Figure 9b and Figure 10b in the Appendix, where\\nwe see an increase in the standard variance (indicated by the\\nshadow area) as the question perplexity increases. However,\\nit is difficult to conclude whether higher question perplexity\\nresults in better or worse ChatGPT reliability, as we observe\\ndifferent tendencies across datasets.\\n102\\n104\\nQuestion PPL\\n101\\n102\\n103\\nAnswer PPL\\nBoolQ (Acc)\\n103\\nQuestion PPL\\n101\\n102\\nOQA (Acc)\\n102\\n104\\nQuestion PPL\\n102\\n104\\nNQA (RougeL)\\n(a) Fluency distribution of questions and ChatGPT answers.\\nColor darkness represents the question count.\\n102\\n103\\nQuestion PPL\\n0\\n25\\n50\\n75\\n100\\nCorrectness (%)\\nBoolQ (Acc)\\n102\\n104\\nQuestion PPL\\n0\\n25\\n50\\n75\\n100\\nOQA (Acc)\\n102\\n104\\nQuestion PPL\\n0\\n25\\n50\\n75\\n100\\nNQA (RougeL)\\n(b) Correctness distribution under fluency.

(Answer: No, the\\nvictim cannot drop the charges\\nonce a prosecutor is involved.)\\nYes, the victim of a domestic violence case can choose to drop the charges in\\nthe United States, but it is important to note that the decision to do so is often\\ncomplex and can have serious consequences. The decision to press charges\\nis ultimately up to the victim, but it is important to consider the safety and\\nwell-being of everyone involved. It may be a good idea to speak with a legal\\nprofessional or a domestic violence advocate before making a decision.\\nCasual\\nan-\\nswers\\nWhat are the advantages to ele-\\nphants in the wild according to\\nthe passage?\\n(A) They face\\nfewer problems.

A toaster converts electrical en-\\nergy into heat energy to toast bread, much like a campfire toasts bread. The\\nheat generated by the toaster is used to cook the bread, just as the heat from\\nthe campfire is used to cook the bread. Explanation: (A) “a campfire toasts\\nbread” is the correct answer because both a toaster and a campfire use heat to\\ncook food, in this case, toast bread. (B) “a microwave heats soup” is incorrect\\nbecause a microwave uses microwave radiation to heat food, not heat energy.\\n(C) “a fire burns paper” is incorrect because a fire is a chemical reaction that\\nreleases heat and light, not just heat. (D) “a small oven works” is incorrect\\nbecause an oven uses heat energy to cook food, but it is not specifically men-\\ntioned as toasting bread.\\nReferential\\nconfusion\\nLions and tigers will not kill or\\neat men _ . (A) unless men try to\\nrun away (B) if they are too old\\nand too weak (C) if they are able\\nto get enough food (D) however\\nmen act towards them (Answer:\\nC)\\nThe answer is (B) if they are too old and too weak. According to the article,\\nlions and tigers will only kill and eat men when they have grown too old and\\ntoo weak to catch their usual food, such as deer and other small animals.\\n19\\nTable 11: Four refusal reasons given by ChatGPT.

The release of ChatGPT [3] contributed to the widespread use\\nof AI-generated text tools while leading to concerns that the abuse of ChatGPT may bring misleading information,\\nphishing, and academic dishonesty [4]. Therefore, some studies [5] attempt to build detectors based on the pre-trained\\nlanguage model for ChatGPT-generated texts to prevent the abuse of the powerful ChatGPT.\\nHowever, detectors that perform well in intra-domain scenarios have poor robustness due to being easily attacked\\nby carefully designed strategies such as paraphrasing and polishing [6], which refers to the process of revising and\\nimproving the original text. Although retrieval [7] can help mitigate this problem, it still poses significant challenges,\\nsuch as high costs and lack of explanation. Moreover, as pointed out by the Association for Computational Linguistics\\n(ACL), it is necessary to establish a grading system for the degree to which large models participate in the paper\\ngeneration process 2.\\nIn order to identify ChatGPT-polished texts and provide users with more intuitive explanations, we create a novel\\ndataset called HPPT (ChatGPT-polished academic abstracts instead of fully generated ones) for training a detector and\\nalso propose the Polish Ratio method which measures the degree of modification made by ChatGPT compared to the\\noriginal human-written text. Through experiments, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of our model in accurately\\n∗Corresponding Author\\n2https://2023.aclweb.org/blog/ACL-2023-policy\\narXiv:2307.11380v2  [cs.CL]  30 Dec 2023\\nIs ChatGPT Involved in Texts? Measure the Polish Ratio to Detect ChatGPT-Generated Text\\nidentifying polished texts trained on our novel dataset. Moreover, our explanation method, the Polish Ratio, has shown\\npromising results on both our own dataset and other datasets that have not been seen before: there are significant distinct\\ndistributions in the predicted Polish Ratio of human-written, ChatGPT-polished, and ChatGPT-generated texts. Our\\ncontributions are: a) we build a Human-ChatGPT Polished Paired abstracT (HPPT) dataset, containing polished and\\noriginal paired abstracts with similarity measurements as the degree of polishing. b) We propose the Polish Ratio\\nto help explain the detection model indicating the modification degree of the text by ChatGPT. c) The experimental\\nresults show that our model performs better than other baselines on three datasets. The code and dataset are available:\\nhttps://github.com/Clement1290/ChatGPT-Detection-PR-HPPT.\\n2\\nRelated Work\\nAlong with the appearance of large language models such as ChatGPT, some detection algorithms are proposed to\\nprevent the abuse of such powerful AI-generated text models. Recent detection methods can be roughly grouped\\ninto two categories [8]: white-box and black-box detectors. The white-box detector needs to access the distributed\\nprobability or vocabulary of the target language model, while the black-box detector only checks the output text of the\\ntarget model. Table 1 summarizes recent algorithms that detect ChatGPT-generated texts.\\nDetector\\nOpen Source\\nBlack Box\\nDetection basis\\nExplanation\\nDetectGPT\\n[9]\\n✓\\n✗\\nProbability Score\\n/\\nWatermarks\\n[10]\\n✓\\n✗\\nRed & Green Tokens\\n/\\nRoberta-based-detector\\n[5]\\n✓\\n✓\\nOutput String\\n/\\nOpenAI\\n[11]\\n✗\\n✓\\nOutput String\\n/\\nGPTZero\\n✗\\n✓\\nOutput String\\n/\\nDistilBERT-based-detector\\n[12]\\n✗\\n✓\\nOutput String\\nSHAP\\nOurs\\n✓\\n✓\\nOutput String\\nPolish Ratio\\nTable 1: Summary of recent algorithms detecting ChatGPT-generated texts.\\n[13] is a popular white-box detector, which takes advantage of the probability and entropy of the linguistic patterns,\\nwhile DetectGPT [9] utilizes the observation that ChatGPT texts tend to lie in areas where the log probability function\\nhas negative curvature to conduct zero-shot detection. Watermark-based detection methods [10, 14] need to divide the\\nvocabulary into a randomized set of words that is softly prompted to use during sampling (\"green\" tokens) and the\\nremaining words (\"red\" tokens), and modify the logits embedding when the model generates the results.\\nTraining another classifier as the detector with labeled data [11, 12, 5] is a mainstream black-box method. [5] finetunes\\nthe Roberta on the HC3 (Human ChatGPT Comparison Corpus) dataset to obtain an effective detector. However, the\\nsimple ChatGPT-generated texts in the HC3 dataset make the model trained on it vulnerable to being attacked using the\\npolishing strategy, and the robustness is not ensured. Moreover, some effective detectors are not open-source and are\\ndirectly used for commercial operations, such as GPTZero 3 and OriginalityAI 4.\\nOn the other hand, the existing black-box detectors rarely provide explanations for the prediction. [15] proposed Local\\nInterpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) to explain the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and\\nfaithful manner by learning an interpretable model locally around the prediction. [16] proposed the SHapley Additive\\nexPlanations (SHAP) method to assign each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Although they\\nperform effectively on basic NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis [17], they do not provide a convincing explanation to\\nusers in ChatGPT detection task [12], compelling us to step forward and address this gap.\\n3https://gptzero.me/\\n4https://originality.ai/\\n2\\nIs ChatGPT Involved in Texts? Measure the Polish Ratio to Detect ChatGPT-Generated Text\\n3\\nMethod\\nTo facilitate detecting ChatGPT-polished texts and offer more intuitive explanations to assist final judgment, we first\\ncollect human-written abstracts and polish all of them using ChatGPT forming Human-ChatGPT Polished Paired\\nabstracT (HPPT) dataset. Additionally, for each abstract pair in the dataset, we furnish three different similarity metrics\\n(Jaccard Distance, Levenshtein Distance, and BERT semantic similarity) between the human-written abstract and the\\ncorresponding abstract polished by ChatGPT. Based on the data, we train the Roberta model as the detector to conduct\\nthe detection task. Meanwhile, we also train the Polish Ratio model to explain the detection result to reveal the degree\\nof ChatGPT involvement. The overall detection process is shown in Figure 1.\\nFigure 1: The study design of our detection method.\\n3.1\\nHPPT Dataset: Human-ChatGPT Polished Paired abstractT\\nSince the existing datasets are specifically designed for purely ChatGPT-generated detection, such as HC3 [5] and\\nignore the ChatGPT-polished texts, we first construct the Human-ChatGPT Polished Paired abstracT (HPPT) dataset.\\nSpecifically, we collect human-written abstracts of accepted papers from several popular NLP academic conferences\\nand polish all of them using ChatGPT 5. The texts in our dataset are paired, making it easy to observe the difference\\nbetween human-written and ChatGPT-polished texts. Overall, we collect 6050 pairs of abstracts and corresponding\\npolished versions from the ACL anthology (ACL, EMNLP, COLING, and NAACL) in the past five years (2018-2022):\\n2525 are from ACL, 914 are from EMNLP, 1572 are from COLING, and 1039 are from NAACL.\\nTo uncover the distinctions between human-written and ChatGPT-polished texts, we compute their similarities using\\nthree metrics: BERT semantic similarity6, Jaccard Distance, and Levenshtein Distance (details are presented in section\\n3.3). As shown in Figure 2, the paired texts are semantically similar in BERT semantic similarity, which shows it\\nis difficult to distinguish human-written and ChatGPT-Polished abstracts from BERT-based semantics. But Jaccard\\nDistance and Levenshtein Distance provide a better way to distinguish them as they align closely with the Gaussian\\ndistribution, making them suitable for measuring the degree of ChatGPT involvement.\\n3.2\\nDetection: Roberta-based black box model\\nFollowing the previous work [5], we treat the detection as a binary classification task and build a black-box detector\\nutilizing the Roberta model [19] because the model of ChatGPT is not accessible, as discussed in the Section 2. Unlike\\nthem, we regard the original abstract without polishing as human-written, and its corresponding ChatGPT polished\\nabstract is regarded as ChatGPT involved.\\n5The prompt is \"please polish the following sentences:<abstracts>\". We also tested the prompt \"please rewrite the following\\nsentences:<abstracts>\" and found that there is no big difference using \"polish\" or \"rewrite\". The differences of Levenshtein Distance\\nor Jaccard Distance between using “polish” and “rewrite” for most sample pairs are within the range of 0.1.\\n6BERT semantic similarity refers to the cosine similarity between two sentences’ embeddings using the BERT model. Here we\\nuse the SciBERT model [18].\\n3\\nIs ChatGPT Involved in Texts? Measure the Polish Ratio to Detect ChatGPT-Generated Text\\nJaccard Distance\\nLevenshtein Distance\\nBERT semantic similarity\\nFigure 2: Similarity distribution of polished abstracts in our HPPT dataset.\\n3.3\\nExplanation\\nDue to the black box nature of many existing detectors, they are unable to provide explanations that are crucial for\\ndifferentiating ChatGPT-Polished text. Therefore, we employ two independent explanation methods GLTR (Giant\\nLanguage model Test Room) and Polish Ratio (PR). This approach is favored over posterior explanation methods such\\nas SHAP, ensuring more comprehensive justifications for our final judgments.\\n• GLTR: Giant Language model Test Room [13] is a statistical method used for AI-generated text detection\\n(mainly for GPT-2). It assumes that human-written text uses a wider subset of the distribution under a model.\\nAlthough it was initially designed for GPT-2-generated text detection, we formulate a hypothesis that the\\ndistribution of GPT-2 and ChatGPT-generated texts is similar in some way since both are AI-generated texts. It\\nuses three criteria to help detection: (1) The probability of the word, as shown in Equation 1; (2) The absolute\\nrank of a word that is the rank of the Equation 1; (3) The entropy of the predicted distribution, as shown in\\nEquation 2.\\nProbi = pdet(Xi|X1:i−1)\\n(1)\\nEntropyi = −\\nX\\nw\\npdet(Xi = w|X1:i−1)log(pdet(Xi = w|X1:i−1))\\n(2)\\nSpecifically, if a text is written by a human, a word should have a low probability, which leads to a higher top\\nrank and the entropy also should be large.\\nWe consider the GLTR as our baseline for the explanation method as we have discovered that the method is\\neffective in explaining the distinction between human-written and entirely ChatGPT-generated texts. However,\\nit fails to provide adequate explanations when ChatGPT-polished texts are present (refer to Section 4.3 for\\nfurther details). To address this issue, we adopt a new method called the Polish Ratio.\\n4\\nIs ChatGPT Involved in Texts? Measure the Polish Ratio to Detect ChatGPT-Generated Text\\n• PR: Polish Ratio is a new metric we propose to measure the degree of ChatGPT involvement for a text. It\\nmeasures the degree of text modification before and after revision using ChatGPT by calculating the similarity\\nscore between original human-written texts and the corresponding polished texts. In our dataset HPPT, we\\ntake two metrics Jaccard Distance and Levenshtein Distance (Levenshtein Distance is normalized by the\\nmaximum length of the two sequences) as the Polish Ratio. Since ChatGPT generates the text using tokens,\\nwe evaluate the distances based on white-space tokenized words. As shown in Equation 3, Jaccard distance\\nmeasures the dissimilarity between sets by comparing the size of their intersection and union. Levenshtein\\ndistance measures the difference between two sequences by counting the minimum number of edits (deletion,\\ninsertion, and substitution), as shown in Equation 4.\\nJ(A, B) = 1 −|A ∩B|\\n|A ∪B|\\n(3)\\nWhere:\\n– A, B are the set of words in the document text strings.\\n– | · | represents the cardinality (number of elements) of the set.\\nlev(a, b) =\\n\\uf8f1\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\uf8f2\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\uf8f3\\nmax(|a|, |b|) if min(|a|, |b|) = 0\\nmin\\n\\uf8f1\\n\\uf8f2\\n\\uf8f3\\nlev(a[2 :], b[2 :]) + 1,\\nlev(a[2 :], b[1 :]) + 1,\\nlev(a[1 :], b[2 :]) + 1\\n\\uf8fc\\n\\uf8fd\\n\\uf8feotherwise\\n(4)\\nWhere:\\n– a, b represent a list of white-space tokenized words in the document.\\n– | · | represents the length of the word list.\\n– lev(a[i :], b[j :]) represents the Levenshtein distance between the sublist of a starting at index i and b\\nstarting at index j.\\nTherefore, we regard the PR model as the regression model where either the Jaccard distance or normalized\\nLevenshtein distance of the polished texts is the target value of the Polish Ratio. In ideal conditions, the\\npredicted PR value of an abstract should approach 0 for a human-written one and should be close to 1 when\\nChatGPT revises a majority of words in the abstract. We use the Roberta-based model to extract feature\\nxi ∈R768 of each sentence i and use an MLP to conduct the final regression task. The sigmoid function is\\nchosen as the activation function to ensure the range of the regression result is in [0, 1]. Compared to other\\nexplanation indices like confidence level, our PR method takes advantage of the paired abstracts before and\\nafter polishing to measure how much the ChatGPT involvement is, which can give a more independent and\\nconvincing explanation.\\n4\\nExperiment and analysis\\n4.1\\nExperiment Setup\\n4.1.1\\nDataset\\nWe conduct experiments on the following three datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.\\n• HPPT\\nIt is our built ChatGPT-polished dataset, which consists of 6050 pairs of recent abstracts and corresponding\\npolished versions. Meanwhile, to measure the degree of ChatGPT involvement in the text, we also provide\\nthe Levenshtein distance and Jaccard distance of the polished abstracts compared with their corresponding\\nhuman-written ones as the labeled PR value and label 0 as the PR value of those human-written abstracts. We\\nrandomly partition the HPPT into the train, test, and validation sets by 6 : 3 : 1 to train and test our model\\n(Roberta-HPPT).\\n• HC3 [5]\\nThe HC3 (Human ChatGPT Comparison Corpus) dataset7 is one of the most popular ChatGPT detection\\ndatasets containing question-answering QA pairs. The human answers are collected from publicly available\\n7https://huggingface.co/datasets/Hello-SimpleAI/HC3/tree/main\\n5\\nIs ChatGPT Involved in Texts? Measure the Polish Ratio to Detect ChatGPT-Generated Text\\nquestion-answering datasets and wiki text, while the answers provided by ChatGPT are obtained from its\\npreview website through manual input of questions for each interaction. We choose its English version corpus,\\nwhich consists of 85,449 QA pairs (24,322 questions, 58,546 human answers, and 26,903 ChatGPT answers).\\nWe randomly partition the HC3 into the train, test, and validation sets by 6 : 3 : 1 and regard the answer text\\nas the input of our detection model to ensure the detector’s versatility. In addition, it is also used to train our\\nbaseline model (Roberta-HC3).\\n• CDB [20]\\nThe ChatGPT-Detector-Bias Dataset8 (CDB) is a mixed dataset consisting of 749 text samples derived from\\nhuman, ChatGPT and GPT-4. The human data is from TOEFL essays in a Chinese educational forum, US\\nCollege Admission essays, and scientific abstracts from Stanford’s course CS224n. The GPT data consists of\\nsamples polished by both ChatGPT and GPT-4, as well as essays fully generated by ChatGPT using different\\nprompts. We also take it as the harder dataset to test the detectors’ generalization ability because it not only\\ncontains the GPT-4-generated or GPT-4-polished text but also contains well-designed prompt engineering\\nChatGPT-generated text and the human writing samples from both native and non-native English writers.\\n4.1.2\\nReproduction details\\nDuring training our detection model, we use the batch size 16, learning rate 2e −5 and the maximum epoch is set to 10.\\nThe model is chosen as the best one on the validation set. While training our PR model, we use batch size 4, learning\\nrate 1e −5, and the maximum epoch is set to 15.\\n4.2\\nDetection Result\\nTable 2 shows several baselines and our model performance on three datasets. Our model performs well on both\\nin-domain dataset HPPT and out-of-domain datasets (HC3 and CDB), suggesting that our model trained on the polished\\nHPPT dataset is more robust than other models. Although the Roberta-HPPT model is only trained on HPPT, it achieves\\ncomparable performance compared to the SOTA model in HC3, with only a 3% difference and better than DetectGPT.\\nOn the more difficult dataset (CBD), our model significantly outperforms other baselines with 88.15% accuracy.\\nSpecifically, our model only drops 6% on the out-of-domain dataset while the Roberta-HC3 and the DetectGPT drop by\\nnearly 40%, demonstrating the strong robustness of our model. The reason is that our model is trained on the ChatGPT-\\npolished text instead of ChatGPT-generated text, which can tackle more difficult samples such as GPT-4-generated,\\nGPT-4-polished, and well-designed prompt engineering ChatGPT-generated texts.\\nTest\\nDataset\\nACC\\nAUROC\\nHPPT\\nHC3\\nCDB\\nHPPT\\nHC3\\nCDB\\nGPTZero\\n-\\n-\\n0.4406\\n-\\n-\\n0.6818\\nOpenAI-GPT-2\\n-\\n-\\n0.4633\\n-\\n-\\n0.5604\\nOriginalityAI\\n-\\n-\\n0.4967\\n-\\n-\\n0.5721\\nDetectGPT\\n0.5129\\n0.8309\\n0.4593\\n0.6876\\n0.9058\\n0.7308\\nRoberta-HC3\\n0.5285\\n0.9991\\n0.5848\\n0.7946\\n1\\n0.7526\\nRoberta\\n-HPPT (ours)\\n0.9465\\n0.9671\\n0.8825\\n0.9947\\n0.9931\\n0.9518\\nTable 2: The detection performance of some popular detection models.

Motivated by this, we adopt two explanation methods (GLTR and Polish\\nRatio) to measure them.\\n4.3.1\\nGLTR\\nFigure 3 shows the visualization of the probability, absolute rank, and the distribution’s entropy of two pairs of\\ntexts from HC3 and HPPT. A higher concentration of green tokens indicates that the words are selected from the\\n8https://huggingface.co/datasets/WxWx/ChatGPT-Detector-Bias\\n6\\nIs ChatGPT Involved in Texts?

A word that ranks within the top 10 probability is highlighted in green, top 100 in yellow, top 1,000 in\\nred, and the rest in purple. Sample 1 and Sample 2 are chosen from the HC3 test set, while Sample 3 and Sample 4 are\\nchosen from the HPPT test set.\\ntop-ranked probability generated by the LLM system. Comparing samples 1 and 2, we find that the difference between\\nhuman-written and ChatGPT-generated texts is noticeable. Texts entirely generated by ChatGPT prefer to use those\\ntop-rank probability words, which validates our hypothesis in Section 3.3. However, it is relatively hard to distinguish\\nhuman-written and ChatGPT-polished texts, as illustrated in samples 3 and 4. The reason is that the fraction of top-rank\\nprobability words employed in polished texts decreases significantly, approaching that of human-written texts. As a\\nresult, the GLTR explanation mechanism proves challenging in this scenario.\\n4.3.2\\nPolish Ratio Regression\\nTherefore, we propose Polish Ratio to explain the detection result of both entirely ChatGPT-generated and ChatGPT-\\npolished texts. As shown in Table 3, we try Jaccard distance and Levenshtein distance as the true label of the Polish Ratio\\nrespectively. Considering the influence of outliers and the unbalanced samples because of 0 PR ones (human-written\\nabstracts), we try different loss functions to test their effectiveness. Suppose the target value for the Polish Ratio of each\\ntext sample i is yi and the predicted value is ˆyi, the different losses ℓi for sample i are defined as:\\nL1(yi, ˆyi) = |yi −ˆyi|\\n(5)\\nSmoothL1(yi, ˆyi) =\\n\\x1a0.5 · (yi −ˆyi)2\\nif |yi −ˆyi| < β\\n|yi −ˆyi| −0.5 · β\\notherwise\\n(6)\\nLMSE(yi, ˆyi) = (yi −ˆyi)2\\n(7)\\nwhere L1 is L1-loss, SmoothL1 is smooth L1-loss and LMSE is the mean square error while the loss for all N samples\\nis calculated as ℓ(y, ˆy) = 1\\nN\\nPN\\ni=1 ℓi. Through the experiment, we find that MSE is the best choice.\\n7\\nIs ChatGPT Involved in Texts?

It not only effectively distinguishes between human-written\\nand polished texts but also successfully discriminates ChatGPT-generated texts that are not encountered during the\\ntraining stage. While both Jaccard distance and Levenshtein distance serve as suitable PR metrics to differentiate the\\nCP and CG groups, the use of Levenshtein distance proves to be more effective, where the median Polish Ratio of\\nChatGPT-polished texts is around 0.5, while that of ChatGPT-generated texts is around 0.65. According to the violin\\nplot shown in Figure 4b, we suggest a Polish Ratio greater than 0.2 indicates ChatGPT involvement, and a value greater\\nthan 0.6 indicates that ChatGPT generates most words.\\n4.4\\nCase study for Polish Ratio\\nOur Polish Ratio is also accurate in the case study. Table 4 is the case study of the Polish Ratio regression on the index\\nLevenshtein Distance. Indeed, it can effectively differentiate the extent of modification introduced by ChatGPT. For\\ninstance, the degree of text modification by ChatGPT varies significantly between text (1b) and text (2b), as highlighted\\nin red, leading to a notable difference in their PR values, which proves the effectiveness of our PR method.\\n4.5\\nError Analysis\\nWe conduct an error analysis to gain insights into our model’s learning process and assess the efficacy of our explanation\\nmethods. We focus on understanding the reasons behind the mistakes the baseline model and our model made in the\\nHPPT dataset, shown in Table 5.\\nThe result shows that the baseline model only trained on the purely ChatGPT-generated text exhibited confusion when\\nencountering a polishing attack, as evidenced by the classification of nearly all polished samples as human-written. In\\ncontrast, our model (Roberta-HPPT) tends to make mistakes for originally human-written texts, as shown in Table 5.\\nBy exploring the Polish Ratio of these misclassified samples, we find misclassified samples have a relatively high PR\\nwhich originally should be close to 0 PR for human-written samples, as shown in Figure 5. This discovery indicates\\nthat our PR method can explain the reasons why the detection model makes mistakes: the writing style of original\\nhuman-written texts may be similar to that of ChatGPT.\\n8\\nIs ChatGPT Involved in Texts? Measure the Polish Ratio to Detect ChatGPT-Generated Text\\nText\\nSource\\nPR\\n1a) Theoretical work in morphological typology offers the possibility of measuring morphological\\ndiversity on a continuous scale. However, literature in Natural Language Processing (NLP)\\ntypically labels a whole language with a strict type of morphology, e.g. fusional or agglutinative.\\nIn this work, we propose to reduce the rigidity of such claims, by quantifying morphological\\ntypology at the word and segment level.

Emblematic of this revolution is ChatGPT, a tool that has rapidly and \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n2 \\nprofoundly infiltrated our lives, transforming everything from the labor market to the landscape of \\nscientific publishing (Bertolo & Antonelli, 2023; Ghassemi et al., 2023; Kaiser, 2023; Nature \\nCancer , 2023; Noy & Zhang, 2023). A global survey by Nature, involving 1600 researchers, \\nunderlines this paradigm shift, revealing that a majority view AI tools as \\'very important\\' or \\n\\'essential\\' for their research in the coming decade. Recognizing ChatGPT\\'s extensive impact across \\nvarious scientific disciplines, Nature has acknowledged it as one of the most influential entities in \\nscience for the year 2023 (Noorden & Webb, 2023.; Van Noorden & Perkel, 2023). \\nBy harnessing vast amounts of human-generated data, such as the Internet, ChatGPT has \\nexhibited remarkable capabilities in activities ranging from coding to creative writing, often \\nsurpassing human performance. Empirical evidence suggests that ChatGPT is instrumental in \\nreducing labor market inequalities, enabling workers of varied skills to enhance productivity \\nsignificantly (Noy & Zhang, 2023). Remarkably, in realms traditionally considered exclusive to \\nhuman ingenuity—like literature, music, and art—generative AI tools have demonstrated \\nextraordinary prowess (Nature Machine Intelligence, 2022; Epstein et al., 2023; Rafner, Beaty, \\nKaufman, Lubart, & Sherson, 2023). ChatGPT, for instance, has not only matched human creativity \\nin various tests but has also been instrumental in amplifying it, heralding a new era of human-AI \\nco-creativity (Folk, 2023; Jia, Luo, Fang, & Liao, 2023; Koivisto & Grassini, 2023; Rafner et al., \\n2023). \\nHowever, this technological marvel is not without its detractors. Concerns range from \\nexacerbating biases and privacy breaches to perpetuating misinformation (Acion, Rajngewerc, \\nRandall, & Etcheverry, 2023; Bockting, Van Dis, Van Rooij, Zuidema, & Bollen, 2023; Choudhury, \\n2023; Kidd & Birhane, 2023; Porsdam Mann et al., 2023). A particularly salient issue is the \\npotential for content homogenization, as researchers and creators increasingly rely on AI tools \\ntrained on uniform databases (Nakadai, Nakawake, & Shibasaki, 2023; Wong & C, 2023). While \\nthis may initially facilitate information dissemination and spark imagination, it could, over time, \\nhinder the diversity of thought crucial for groundbreaking innovations. This paradox places \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n3 \\nresearchers at a crossroads, exhilarated by the transformative capabilities of tools like ChatGPT, \\nyet cautious of their far-reaching implications. \\n1.1  Research questions and significance \\nAs generative AI continues to evolve, the extent to which we should allow it to permeate our \\nscientific work, and the degree to which we should permit opaque algorithms to replace our creative \\nactivities, are pressing questions needing answers (Acion et al., 2023; Jo & A, 2023; Nakadai et al., \\n2023). To address these, we need to delve deeper into three key questions. Research Question1: \\nWhile using ChatGPT for creative activities may seem to enhance our performance in the short \\nterm, what are the long-term impacts of its use in creative work? Research Question2: What \\nhappens to our creative behavior if we become overly reliant on ChatGPT for co-creativity and \\nthen suddenly lose access to it? In other words, is the creativity augmented by ChatGPT genuine? \\nResearch Question3: Does ChatGPT hinder innovation, leading to a homogenization of ideas and \\npossibly resulting in a loss of scientific diversity? \\nThe advent of generative AI, akin to opening Pandora\\'s Box, presents a complex landscape of \\nopportunities and challenges. While AI assistance offers manifold benefits, it also represents a \\ndouble-edged sword, necessitating a careful balance between leveraging its advantages and \\nmitigating its risks. \\nTo investigate the three research questions, this study enrolled 61 university students, \\nrandomly allocating them into an independent group or a ChatGPT-assisted group, for a \\ncomprehensive seven-day lab experiment followed by a one-month follow-up survey. Over the \\ncourse of the study, they engaged in 16 diverse creative tasks, generating a robust dataset of 3302 \\nideas and 427 solutions. Specifically, participants were tasked with completing two types of \\ncreative assignments each day, either independently or with the aid of ChatGPT. The first task was \\na low-complexity alternative uses test (AUT) with a three-minute time limit, and the second, a \\nhigh-complexity task involving the addition of new features to a product for a company, requiring \\nsolution proposals. This long-term laboratory study aimed to explore the impact of prolonged use \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n4 \\nof ChatGPT on individual continuous innovation capabilities, compared to completing creative \\ntasks independently. We focused particularly on how people\\'s innovative performances would \\nchange if they suddenly lost access to ChatGPT, having become overly dependent on it for creative \\ntasks. Compared to the independent completion group, does the use of ChatGPT lead to a \\nconvergence in people\\'s overall ideas, and does this convergence persist even after the removal of \\nChatGPT? In essence, we sought to investigate whether prolonged use of ChatGPT enhances \\ncreativity but leads to more homogenized content, and whether such enhancements in creativity \\nand homogenization persist in future creative activities after ChatGPT is no longer used. \\n2  Method: One-week-experimental design  \\n2.1  Participants \\nSixty-one college students (Mage = 21.56 years, SD = 2.62) with 31 different majors from a \\nuniversity completed the lab experiment (per-registered at https://osf.io/hea8r). 36 of them were \\nfemale. Participants were invited to complete a series of lab experiment that last for a week without \\nintervals. After consenting to the study, they were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: \\nChatGPT use (the treatment group, n = 31) and no ChatGPT use (the control group, n = 30).  \\n2.2  Materials and procedure \\nTo capture the full picture of creativity, we adopted 14 different creative tasks to measure \\nparticipant’s divergent thinking and convergent thinking, two critical yet distinct pathway to \\ncreativity. Whereas divergent thinking involves the generation of multiple ideas in diverse \\ndirections (e.g., listing the unusual uses for a pen, Guilford, 1967), convergent thinking involves \\nidentifying the best solution to a clearly defined problem (e.g., Duncker’s candle problem; Duncker, \\n1945).  \\nAll participants were asked to complete two types of creativity tasks each day: a low-\\ncomplexity task (AUT: generating alternative uses for a product) and a high-complexity task \\n(Come up with innovative function points and propose solutions for the products developed in the \\nenterprise). In the first AUT task, participants had a maximum of 3 minutes to list creative uses for \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n5 \\neveryday objects, such as a pen or a brick. Then, the experimenter would ask the participants to \\nfind the best way to solve a real-life problem (Task 2), such as developing new functions for a VR \\nglasses. For task 2, there is no time limited. The orders of tasks were counter-balanced. \\nIn the first day and the last day, all participants were invited to finish the same two creative \\ntasks without any ChatGPT assistance. We did so to make sure there was no significant difference \\non baseline creativity (Day1). More importantly, we were curious about whether there was a \\nremaining manipulated impacts of ChatGPT use experiences on creativity performance (Day7).  \\nWe manipulated the ChatGPT use experiences during the middle 5 days (from Day 2 to Day \\n6). We provided half of the participants (the treatment group) ChatGPT 4.0 to help them to finish \\nthe creative tasks, while the other half still finished the same two creative tasks by themselves (the \\ncontrol group). The flow of experimental design was depicted in Figure 1. \\nFigure1 Experimental Design \\n \\n2.3  Creativity code and assessment  \\nTwo experimenters were trained to code the text content. For AUT task, we extracted \\nindependent ideas from the text content. Preliminary analysis showed that participants came up \\nwith at least 351 (Day 7) to maximum 501 (Day 4) ideas per day, averaged at 5.75 ideas per person. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n6 \\nFor problem-solving task, we remained all their answers. We randomized the order in a spreadsheet \\nwithout any identifying information.  \\nWe had four (two for each task) coders who were blind to the study purposes and experimental \\nconditions rate participants’ responses, adherent to the consensual assessment technique (CAT, \\nAmabile, 1996). We provided raters with the spreadsheet and instructed them to evaluate each idea \\nin it.  \\nAssessment on divergent thinking. In AUT tasks, two raters were instructed to independently \\nrate participants’ each idea in terms of novelty (i.e., the originality of the idea) and usefulness (i.e., \\nthe practicality of the idea). The interrater reliabilities for both aspects were satisfactory (ICCs \\n≥ .90). Participants’ level of novelty and usefulness was respectively computed by summing the \\nscores of each idea. Flexibility of each participant was subjective and was obtained by counting \\nthe total number of unique usage categories. Besides, we asked participants to select the most \\ncreative idea when they complected the AUT task. So, we computed participants’ self-recognition \\naccuracy by subtracting the score of the selected idea from the maximum score of this participant.  \\nAssessment on convergent thinking. In problem-solving task, another two raters who had \\nrich work experiences on new project development were instructed to independently rate \\nparticipants’ responses in four different ways: (1) creativity (i.e., the novel and useful level of idea); \\n(2) content quality (i.e., the writing, structures, and logics of the idea), (3) public popularity (i.e., \\nprediction on customer’s favor if the idea was implemented), (4) market success (i.e., prediction \\non product success if the idea was implemented). The interrater reliabilities for all aspects were \\nsatisfactory (ICCs ≥ .90). \\n3  Results \\n3.1  The impact of ChatGPT use on creativity performance  \\nBaseline test. Based on the results of Day 1, there was no significant differences on creativity \\nperformance between two groups, implying that all participants’ creativity were similar.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n7 \\nThe manipulated effects of ChatGPT use on everyday creative tasks. According to the results \\nof Day 2 to Day 6, participants in the ChatGPT condition performed superior to those in the control \\ncondition. To be specific, participants with the help of ChatGPT generated more novel, useful, and \\nflexible usages in the AUT tasks. What is more, when asked to solve a real-life problem, they also \\ncame up with more creative and highly valuable ideas with more potential to gain public favor and \\nmarket success. \\nHowever, we found that ChatGPT failed to help participant to recognize the most creative \\nidea in AUT task, as we observed no significant difference on novelty and usefulness recognition \\naccuracy between two groups.  \\nThe effects of ChatGPT on sustained creativity. Based on the results of Day 7, in which all \\nparticipants completed the creative tasks without any ChatGPT assistance, participants who used \\nChatGPT in the last five days showed a sharp decrease in both divergent thinking and convergent \\nthinking. Specifically, they did not perform better in all kinks of creativity, such as novelty, \\nusefulness, flexibility, content quality, possible public favors, and market success, compared to the \\nparticipants in control group (all p-values were insignificant). One month later (label as Day 30), \\nin the follow-up survey where participants were invited to complete another AUT task (i.e., sponge), \\nwe repeated the findings that there was no significant difference on creativity in terms of novelty, \\nusefulness, and flexibility between participants from the treatment versus control group. Taken \\ntogether, we concluded that although ChatGPT helps people excel in creative tasks, people’s \\ncreativity could not sustain but fall back to the average level once they did not have ChatGPT to \\nrely on.  \\nWe utilized the R packages broom and dplyr for conducting t-tests to compare differences \\nbetween the treatment and control groups. For data visualization, the ggplot2 package was \\nemployed. The results of creative scores are presented in Table 1 and Table 2. The visualization of \\nthese results can be found in Figures 2a and 2b (Only parts related to novelty and usefulness in \\nFigure 2a and 2b are shown; see appendix for the rest..). \\n \\n \\n \\n

In another words, we \\nwere interested to know whether participant with the help from ChatGPT generated more creative \\nbut less diverse responses. If it is true, we would further explore whether this impact would remain \\neven they did not use ChatGPT in the future creative tasks (i.e., Day 7 and Day 30 in this study). \\nWe mainly relied on Machine Learning and the Natural Language Processing technology to \\nestimate the homogeneity of participants’ responses.  \\nUsing SBERT for text semantic similarity calculation. Sentence-BERT (Sentence-\\nBidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers, shorten as SBERT) is an improved \\nmodel based on BERT, designed to better handle sentence-level embeddings (Reimers & \\nGurevych, 2019). Unlike the original BERT model, which encodes individual words, SBERT \\nencodes entire sentences, providing a richer semantic representation. This feature gives SBERT a \\nsignificant advantage in tasks requiring understanding of the entire sentence semantics, such as text \\nsimilarity calculation.  \\nTo use SBERT for text semantic similarity, we first trained the SBERT model. During training, \\nthe model learns semantic relationships between a large number of sentences. Once trained, we \\nused this model to encode sentences from creative texts, obtaining their semantic representations \\n(sentence embedding). Then, we calculated the cosine similarity between these semantic \\nrepresentations of the creative texts to determine their similarity. For example, with two answer \\n\"S1\" and \"S2\", we first encoded them using the SBERT model to obtain two sentences embedding \\n\"Embed1\" and \"Embed2\". We then calculated the cosine similarity between \"Embed1\" and \\n\"Embed2\" as the similarity between \"S1\" and \"S2\". The formula for cosine similarity is as follows: \\ncos(θ) = (A·B) / (||A|| ||B||) \\nA and B are two sentences embedding, \"·\" denotes the dot product of the vectors, and \"||A||\" \\nand \"||B||\" are the lengths (or norms) of vectors A and B, respectively. During the calculation, we \\nfirst computed the dot product of sentence embedding A and B, then calculated the norms of \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n14 \\nsentence embedding A and B, and finally divided the dot product by the product of the norms, \\nresulting in the cosine similarity.  \\nThe flow of SBERT was presented in Figure 3. \\nFigure3 \\nBased on the results of Day 1 using SBERT, we found that all participants shared a heterogeneous \\nresponse towards to the tasks (the similarity of MC = 0.36, the similarity of ME = 0.35, n.s). \\nHowever, the knowledge diversity became lost when some of them began to use ChatGPT to \\ngenerate answers (the similarity of MC = [0.3, 0.48], the similarity of ME = [0.35, 59], ps ≤ .01), \\nand it remained a decreasing trend in one month later (the similarity of MC = 0.33, the similarity of \\nME = 0.39, p ≤ .001), in which they did not use ChatGPT to complete the creative tasks at all. As \\na comparison, we did not find the same pattern in participants who did not use ChatGPT during the \\nwhole study. To cross-validate the findings, we also used String Matching algorithm to compute \\nthe common string in the context, another index to reflect the context similarity.  \\nUsing String Matching for text redundancy calculation. String matching was implemented \\nthrough a series of algorithms that can identify and compare common character sequences between \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n15 \\ntwo texts. We used string matching techniques to assess the redundancy between two creative texts. \\nThis method is widely used in academia to detect plagiarism in papers. Our goal was to determine \\nthe \"literal\" similarity between creative texts, which was achieved by identifying identical string \\nsequences in two answers.  \\nIn this study, we employed an improved String Matching Technique that compares not only \\nindividual characters but also considers the sequence of characters in a string. Our algorithm first \\nconverted the two creative texts “S1” and “S2” into separate strings and then searched for repeated \\nsequences longer than two characters. This method helped to exclude accidental or insignificant \\nmatches, thereby increasing the accuracy of redundancy assessment. The calculation process \\nincludes several key steps: 1) Preprocessing: Convert “S1” and “S2” into a standard format to \\nensure consistency. 2) Match Searching: Search for repeated strings longer than two characters in \\nboth sentences. 3) Redundancy Calculation: Calculate the mean of repeated strings for a task. We \\nfound that by considering strings longer than two characters, we can effectively assess the \\nredundancy rate between the two creative texts “S1” and “S2”, while avoiding overemphasis on \\nshort, common phrases. This method provided a more precise framework for understanding the \\nsubstantive similarity between two sentences. \\nThe results of Day 1 showed that there was a relatively low rate of common strings towards to \\nthe tasks (the redundancy of MC = 0.36, the redundancy of ME = 0.35, n.s). However, in the next \\nfive days when participants used ChatGPT to generate answers, their responses shared a larger rate \\nof common strings than the participants who did not use the ChatGPT (the redundancy of MC = \\n[3.13, 3.4], the redundancy of ME = [5.90, 8.73], ps ≤ .01). So, the knowledge homogeneity caused \\nby ChatGPT use was repeated.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n16 \\nTable 3 Results of similarity and redundancy of the context \\n \\nSBERT \\nString \\nMatching \\n \\nSBERT \\nString Matching \\nTASK1 Control GPT Control GPT TASK2 Control GPT Control GPT \\nDay 1 \\n0.36 \\n0.35 \\n3.44 \\n3.51 \\nDay 1 \\n0.59 \\n0.58 \\n70.4 \\n64.5 \\nDay 2 \\n0.39 \\n0.48 \\n2.73 \\n5.9 \\nDay 2 \\n0.51 \\n0.62 \\n55.82 \\n215.31 \\nDay 3 \\n0.32 \\n0.48 \\n3.17 \\n8.24 \\nDay 3 \\n0.69 \\n0.83 \\n57.65 \\n214.57 \\nDay 4 \\n0.3 \\n0.45 \\n3.33 \\n7.12 \\nDay 4 \\n0.57 \\n0.62 \\n52.41 \\n203.87 \\nDay 5 \\n0.48 \\n0.59 \\n3.4 \\n8.73 \\nDay 5 \\n0.55 \\n0.72 \\n63.71 \\n195.38 \\nDay 6 \\n0.38 \\n0.53 \\n3.13 \\n7.95 \\nDay 6 \\n0.63 \\n0.69 \\n63.57 \\n209.03 \\nDay 7 \\n0.33 \\n0.36 \\n2.76 \\n3.74 \\nDay 7 \\n0.6 \\n0.62 \\n54.74 \\n75.28 \\nDay30 \\n0.33 \\n0.39 \\n1.45 \\n2.34 \\nDay30 \\n/ \\n/ \\n/ \\n/ \\nNote: Numbers in bold are not significant, while the rests are significant (p ≤ .001). \\nTo visualize the above findings, we utilized the SBERT technology to generate sentences \\nsemantic embedding representations for the creativity responses of Group C (the control group) \\nand Group E (the experimental group), so that we could delved into the semantic content of the \\nanswers. To efficiently reduce dimensions and visualize these complex data sets, we initially \\napplied the PCA algorithm with parameters set to n_components = 30. This step was instrumental \\nin diminishing the data dimensions while preserving essential information. Subsequently, we \\nemployed the UMAP algorithm with parameters including n _components = 2, n_neighbors = 5, \\nmin_dist = 0.001, spread = 1.0, metric= \\'cosine\\', init = \\'spectral\\', random _state = 0, and n_jobs = \\n1, to further decrease dimensions, achieving a more refined two-dimensional representation. The \\nparameter settings for UMAP were specifically chosen to optimize data layout, facilitating clearer \\ndifferentiation between distinct data points. Finally, by normalizing the data within the range of 0 \\nto 1 using MinMaxScaler, we ensured the uniformity and comparability of the data. Through this \\nseries of processing steps, we successfully created semantic embedding density distribution maps \\nfor the creativity responses of Groups C and E, thereby visually depicting the differences in \\ncreativity between the two groups. The covariance matrix for each group was represented by an \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n17 \\nellipse, with the ellipse\\'s major and minor axes corresponding to the eigenvalues of the covariance \\nmatrix, and its orientation corresponding to the eigenvectors.  \\nOnce again, the figures demonstrated that the responses generated by the assistance ChatGPT \\n(versus by human-only) generally exerted less standard deviation, eigenvalues, and ellipse area. \\nWhat is more, this tendency was continuing at Day 7 and Day 30.  \\nTable 4a Results of density (Task 1) \\n \\nStandard Deviation \\nSum of Eigenvalues \\nEllipse Area \\n \\nControl \\nGPT \\nControl \\nGPT \\nControl \\nGPT \\nDay1 \\n0.34 \\n0.32 \\n0.12 \\n0.10 \\n0.17 \\n0.15 \\nDay2 \\n0.40 \\n0.33 \\n0.16 \\n0.11 \\n0.24 \\n0.14 \\nDay3 \\n0.34 \\n0.41 \\n0.12 \\n0.17 \\n0.17 \\n0.14 \\nDay4 \\n0.37 \\n0.32 \\n0.14 \\n0.10 \\n0.22 \\n0.16 \\nDay5 \\n0.36 \\n0.33 \\n0.13 \\n0.11 \\n0.19 \\n0.17 \\nDay6 \\n0.37 \\n0.32 \\n0.14 \\n0.10 \\n0.21 \\n0.14 \\nDay7 \\n0.37 \\n0.38 \\n0.14 \\n0.15 \\n0.22 \\n0.22 \\nDay30 \\n0.39 \\n0.32 \\n0.15 \\n0.10 \\n0.23 \\n0.15 \\n \\nTable 4b Results of density (Task 2) \\n \\nStandard Deviation \\nSum of Eigenvalues \\nEllipse Area \\n \\nControl \\nGPT \\nControl \\nGPT \\nControl \\nGPT \\nDay1 \\n0.45 \\n0.50 \\n0.21 \\n0.25 \\n0.31 \\n0.15 \\nDay2 \\n0.48 \\n0.49 \\n0.23 \\n0.24 \\n0.22 \\n0.20 \\nDay3 \\n0.46 \\n0.53 \\n0.21 \\n0.28 \\n0.33 \\n0.14 \\nDay4 \\n0.48 \\n0.53 \\n0.23 \\n0.28 \\n0.35 \\n0.15 \\nDay5 \\n0.51 \\n0.54 \\n0.26 \\n0.29 \\n0.29 \\n0.18 \\nDay6 \\n0.47 \\n0.53 \\n0.22 \\n0.28 \\n0.32 \\n0.39 \\nDay7 \\n0.50 \\n0.58 \\n0.25 \\n0.34 \\n0.13 \\n0.12 \\n \\nTaken together, we consistently found that five-days of ChatGPT use led to serious \\nhomogeneity, in which participants generated more creative but less heterogeneous responses. \\nWhat is worse, we found a fraught, continuing effect in knowledge homogeneity in future tasks, in \\nwhich people generated AI-like responses even though they did no use ChatGPT.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n18 \\nFigure4a Task1 (AUT): Comparison of the daily density distribution between the experimental group and the control group \\n \\nNote: ‘A’ presents Task1.

These findings are consistent with \\nother studies in the field. However, our research goes a step further by uncovering that \\nthe group assisted by ChatGPT (the experimental group) generated ideas with \\nsignificantly higher homogeneity than the group working independently (the control \\ngroup). This indicates that the assistance of ChatGPT, due to the uniformity of data \\nsources and tools used, leads to a convergence of ideas at a group level. Consequently, \\nthe use of ChatGPT appears to constrain the diversity of innovation. Even more striking \\nis the long-term impact: 30 days later, upon reassessing both groups with an AUT task \\ncompleted independently, we observed that the experimental group, devoid of \\nChatGPT\\'s assistance, regressed to average creativity levels, aligning with the control \\ngroup. However, the homogeneity of ideas in the experimental group remained higher. \\nThis suggests that the boost in individual creativity afforded by ChatGPT is transient. \\nWhen individuals revert to independent creative activities without ChatGPT, their \\ncreativity capabilities diminish; moreover, from a group perspective, long-term reliance \\non ChatGPT for creative tasks ironically increases homogeneity of thought, \\nsignificantly reducing the diversity of group ideas. This effect remains pronounced even \\nafter one month. \\nFrom a broader societal standpoint, unrestricted use of generative AI tools like \\nChatGPT in scientific research, brainstorming, and innovative activities could lead to \\nunintended and potentially disruptive consequences for the scientific community \\n(Nakadai et al., 2023). This unrestricted application could stifle the diversity of ideas, \\nleading to increasingly similar thoughts among scientists worldwide, and a gradual \\ndiminution of unique innovations. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n23 \\n4.1  Implications  \\nFirstly, our study advances the understanding of AI\\'s role in enhancing creativity. \\nThe observed temporary boost in creativity, facilitated by ChatGPT, holds significant \\nimplications for the integration of AI in domains that are heavily reliant on creative \\nprocesses. This insight is crucial for educational psychologists and creative \\nprofessionals, underscoring AI\\'s nuanced role in these fields. While AI tools like \\nChatGPT can significantly aid in immediately resolving creative challenges, their \\nimpact in nurturing long-term creative thinking skills seems limited. This finding \\nprompts a reevaluation in educational and professional settings, where the primary goal \\nis fostering enduring innovative capabilities. A balanced approach is necessary, one tha \\nuses AI tools for immediate creative output while also cultivating and maintaining \\ninherent creative abilities over time. \\nSecondly, our study echoes the challenges posed by ChatGPT to innovation and \\ndiversity in scientific research. The trend toward homogenization of thoughts, \\nevidenced by extensive use of generative AI tools like ChatGPT in creative tasks, poses \\nsignificant challenges to the innovation and diversity essential in scientific research. As \\ndemonstrated by our research, the potential for convergence of ideas may stifle \\noriginality and diversity, which are crucial for scientific breakthroughs. This situation \\ncalls for strategic policy-making by research institutions, funding agencies, and \\ndecision-makers (Bockting et al., 2023; Grimes, Von Krogh, Feuerriegel, Rink, & \\nGruber, 2023; Hutson & M, 2023). To ensure diversity in scientific thought and \\ninnovation, a balance between the efficiencies provided by AI and the encouragement \\nof diverse, original scientific inquiry is needed. This might involve policies that \\npromote varied methodologies and perspectives in research projects, even as AI tools \\nbecome increasingly integrated into the scientific process. \\nFinally, the implications of long-term dependency on ChatGPT and the resulting \\nskill degradation warrant attention. The temporary enhancement in creativity by \\nChatGPT, potentially leading to long-term dependency, highlights concerns about \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n24 \\npossible skill degradation. This is particularly relevant in educational and professional \\ntraining environments. An over-reliance on AI for creative tasks could lead to a decline \\nin the development and retention of fundamental creative skills. Therefore, a balanced \\napproach is essential when integrating AI into learning and professional domains. The \\nfocus should not be limited to immediate efficiency gains but should also encompass \\nthe development and preservation of critical creative skills, ensuring that AI tools are \\nused as supplements to, rather than replacements for, human creativity. \\nThese implications emphasize the need for a nuanced and balanced approach to \\nintegrating AI into creative and scientific domains. As we harness the benefits of AI, \\nit\\'s critical to remain cognizant of its limitations and potential impacts on creativity, \\ninnovation, skill development, and ethical standards in these fields. This understanding \\nwill guide the responsible and effective use of AI to enhance human potential while \\nsafeguarding the core values and skills that drive innovation and creativity. \\n4.2  Limitations and future directions \\nWhile our experiment offers insightful revelations, it is not without its limitations. \\nTo minimize external interferences, we opted for a laboratory setting and conducted \\ntwo types of creativity tasks to comprehensively assess individual creativity levels. \\nHowever, this approach also meant a lack of field research, particularly for high-\\ncomplexity tasks like developing innovative solutions for corporate products. \\nMoreover, the study\\'s composition, featuring 8 low-complexity AUT tasks and 7 \\nhigh-complexity product solution tasks, resulted in a substantial collection of 3302 \\nideas and 427 solutions. Nevertheless, the participant pool was limited to 61 university \\nstudents, encompassing undergraduates, graduates, and Ph.D. candidates. This raises \\nquestions about the sample\\'s representativeness, a limitation we accepted in exchange \\nfor ensuring participant retention and high-quality engagement over the crucial one-\\nweek period, necessary to foster a dependency on ChatGPT in creative tasks. \\nAdditionally, similar to other researchers, we conducted a follow-up survey, but it \\nwas limited to a single instance, one month after the initial experiment. This approach \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n25 \\nwas designed to capture the essence of \"sustained innovation\" and enhance the external \\nvalidity of our findings. However, we advocate for future research to consider longer \\nfollow-up intervals to more accurately gauge the enduring effects of AI tools like \\nChatGPT on creativity and innovation. \\nDespite these constraints, the core findings of our research offer broad applicability. \\nThe fundamental AUT task proved effective in measuring divergent thinking, with \\nrobust results observed on both the seventh and thirtieth days. This study lays the \\ngroundwork for future exploration into the real-world impacts of ChatGPT in \\nprofessional settings, particularly its potential to narrow the scope of group innovation \\nand induce ideational convergence. There is a pressing need for further research, \\nemploying extended follow-up periods, to unravel the long-term effects of ChatGPT \\ndependency on human creativity. The question of whether such dependency\\'s adverse \\nimpacts exacerbate or diminish over time remains a critical avenue for future inquiry. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n26 \\nReference  \\nAcion, L., Rajngewerc, M., Randall, G., & Etcheverry, L. 2023.
